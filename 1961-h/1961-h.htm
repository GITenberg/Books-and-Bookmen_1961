3</span>ELZEVIRS.</h2>
<p><i>The Countryman</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know how much, for
some time past, the editions of the Elzevirs have been in
demand.&nbsp; The fancy for them has even penetrated into the
country.&nbsp; I am acquainted with a man there who denies
himself necessaries, for the sake of collecting into a library
(where other books are scarce enough) as many little Elzevirs as
he can lay his hands upon.&nbsp; He is dying of hunger, and his
consolation is to be able to say, &lsquo;I have all the poets
whom the Elzevirs printed.&nbsp; I have ten examples of each of
them, all with red letters, and all of the right
date.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, no doubt, is a craze, for, good as the
books are, if he kept them to read them, one example of each
would be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Parisian</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he had wanted to read
them, I would not have advised him to buy Elzevirs.&nbsp; The
editions of minor authors which these booksellers published, even
editions &lsquo;of the right date,&rsquo; as you say, are not too
correct.&nbsp; Nothing is good in the books but the type and the
paper.&nbsp; Your friend would have done better to use the
editions of Gryphius or Estienne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fragment of a literary dialogue I translate from
&lsquo;Entretiens sur les Contes de F&eacute;es,&rsquo; a book
which contains more of old talk about books and booksellers than
about fairies and folk-lore.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Entretiens&rsquo;
were published in 1699, about sixteen years after the Elzevirs
ceased to be publishers.&nbsp; The fragment is valuable: first,
because it shows us how early the taste for collecting Elzevirs
was fully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very
sound criticism of the mania.&nbsp; Already, in the seventeenth
century, lovers of the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over
dates, already they knew that a &lsquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo; of 1635
was the right &lsquo;C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; already they were fond
of the red-lettered passages, as in the first edition of the
&lsquo;Virgil&rsquo; of 1636.&nbsp; As early as 1699, too, the
Parisian critic knew that the editions were not very correct, and
that the paper, type, ornaments, and <i>format</i> were their
main attractions.&nbsp; To these we must now add the rarity of
really good Elzevirs.</p>
<p>Though Elzevirs have been more fashionable than at present,
they are still regarded by novelists as the great prize of the
book collector.&nbsp; You read in novels about &ldquo;priceless
little Elzevirs,&rdquo; about books &ldquo;as rare as an old
Elzevir.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have met, in the works of a lady novelist
(but not elsewhere), with an Elzevir
&lsquo;Theocritus.&rsquo;&nbsp; The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon
introduced into one of his romances a romantic Elzevir Greek
Testament, &ldquo;worth its weight in gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Casual
remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion that all
Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price.&nbsp; When a man is
first smitten with the pleasant fever of book-collecting, it is
for Elzevirs that he searches.&nbsp; At first he thinks himself
in amazing luck.&nbsp; In Booksellers&rsquo; Row and in Castle
Street he &ldquo;picks up,&rdquo; for a shilling or two,
Elzevirs, real or supposed.&nbsp; To the beginner, any book with
a sphere on the title-page is an Elzevir.&nbsp; For the
beginner&rsquo;s instruction, two copies of spheres are printed
here.&nbsp; The second is a sphere, an ill-cut, ill-drawn sphere,
which is not Elzevirian at all.&nbsp; The mark was used in the
seventeenth century by many other booksellers and printers.&nbsp;
The first, on the other hand, is a true Elzevirian sphere, from a
play of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s, printed in 1675.&nbsp; Observe
the comparatively neat drawing of the first sphere, and be not
led away after spurious imitations.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Beware, too, of the vulgar error of fancying that little
duodecimos with the mark of the fox and the bee&rsquo;s nest, and
the motto &ldquo;Quaerendo,&rdquo; come from the press of the
Elzevirs.&nbsp; The mark is that of Abraham Wolfgang, which name
is not a pseudonym for Elzevir.&nbsp; There are three sorts of
Elzevir pseudonyms.&nbsp; First, they occasionally reprinted the
full title-page, publisher&rsquo;s name and all, of the book they
pirated.&nbsp; Secondly, when they printed books of a
&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; sort, Jansenist pamphlets and so forth,
they used pseudonyms like &ldquo;Nic. Schouter,&rdquo; on the
&lsquo;Lettres Provinciales&rsquo; of Pascal.&nbsp; Thirdly,
there are real pseudonyms employed by the Elzevirs.&nbsp; John
and Daniel, printing at Leyden (1652&ndash;1655), used the false
name &ldquo;Jean Sambix.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Elzevirs of Amsterdam
often placed the name &ldquo;Jacques le Jeune&rdquo; on their
title-pages.&nbsp; The collector who remembers these things must
also see that his purchases have the right ornaments at the heads
of chapters, the right tail-pieces at the ends.&nbsp; Two of the
most frequently recurring ornaments are the so-called
&ldquo;T&ecirc;te de Buffle&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Sir&egrave;ne.&rdquo;&nbsp; More or less clumsy copies of
these and the other Elzevirian ornaments are common enough in
books of the period, even among those printed out of the Low
Countries; for example, in books published in Paris.</p>
<p>A brief sketch of the history of the Elzevirs may here be
useful.&nbsp; The founder of the family, a Flemish bookbinder,
Louis, left Louvain and settled in Leyden in 1580.&nbsp; He
bought a house opposite the University, and opened a
book-shop.&nbsp; Another shop, on college ground, was opened in
1587.&nbsp; Louis was a good bookseller, a very ordinary
publisher.&nbsp; It was not till shortly before his death, in
1617, that his grandson Isaac bought a set of types and other
material.&nbsp; Louis left six sons.&nbsp; Two of these, Matthew
and Bonaventure, kept on the business, dating <i>ex officina
Elzeviriana</i>.&nbsp; In 1625 Bonaventure and Abraham (son of
Matthew) became partners.&nbsp; The &ldquo;good dates&rdquo; of
Elzevirian books begin from 1626.&nbsp; The two Elzevirs chose
excellent types, and after nine years&rsquo; endeavours turned
out the beautiful &lsquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo; of 1635.</p>
<p>Their classical series in <i>petit format</i> was opened with
&lsquo;Horace&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ovid&rsquo; in 1629.&nbsp; In
1641 they began their elegant piracies of French plays and poetry
with &lsquo;Le Cid.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was worth while being pirated
by the Elzevirs, who turned you out like a gentleman, with
<i>fleurons</i> and red letters, and a pretty frontispiece.&nbsp;
The modern pirate dresses you in rags, prints you murderously,
and binds you, if he binds you at all, in some hideous example of
&ldquo;cloth extra,&rdquo; all gilt, like archaic
gingerbread.&nbsp; Bonaventure and Abraham both died in
1652.&nbsp; They did not depart before publishing (1628), in
<i>grand format</i>, a desirable work on fencing,
Thibault&rsquo;s &lsquo;Acad&eacute;mie de
l&rsquo;Esp&eacute;e.&rsquo;&nbsp; This Tibbald also killed by
the book.&nbsp; John and Daniel Elzevir came next.&nbsp; They
brought out the &lsquo;Imitation&rsquo; (Thom&aelig; a Kempis
canonici regularis ord.&nbsp; S. Augustini De Imitatione Christi,
libri iv.); I wish by taking thought I could add eight
millimetres to the stature of my copy.&nbsp; In 1655 Daniel
joined a cousin, Louis, in Amsterdam, and John stayed in
Leyden.&nbsp; John died in 1661; his widow struggled on, but her
son Abraham (1681) let all fall into ruins.&nbsp; Abraham died
1712.&nbsp; The Elzevirs of Amsterdam lasted till 1680, when
Daniel died, and the business was wound up.&nbsp; The type, by
Christopher Van Dyck, was sold in 1681, by Daniel&rsquo;s
widow.&nbsp; <i>Sic transit gloria</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After he has learned all these matters the amateur has still a
great deal to acquire.&nbsp; He may now know a real Elzevir from
a book which is not an Elzevir at all.&nbsp; But there are
enormous differences of value, rarity, and excellence among the
productions of the Elzevirian press.&nbsp; The bookstalls teem
with small, &ldquo;cropped,&rdquo; dingy, dirty, battered
Elzevirian editions of the classics, <i>not</i> &ldquo;of the
good date.&rdquo;&nbsp; On these it is not worth while to expend
a couple of shillings, especially as Elzevirian type is too small
to be read with comfort by most modern eyes.&nbsp; No, let the
collector save his money; avoid littering his shelves with what
he will soon find to be rubbish, and let him wait the chance of
acquiring a really beautiful and rare Elzevir.</p>
<p>Meantime, and before we come to describe Elzevirs of the first
flight, let it be remembered that the &ldquo;taller&rdquo; the
copy, the less harmed and nipped by the binder&rsquo;s shears,
the better.&nbsp; &ldquo;Men scarcely know how beautiful fire
is,&rdquo; says Shelley; and we may say that most men hardly know
how beautiful an Elzevir was in its uncut and original
form.&nbsp; The Elzevirs we have may be &ldquo;dear,&rdquo; but
they are certainly &ldquo;dumpy twelves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their fair
proportions have been docked by the binder.&nbsp; At the Beckford
sale there was a pearl of a book, a &lsquo;Marot;&rsquo; not an
Elzevir, indeed, but a book published by Wetstein, a follower of
the Elzevirs.&nbsp; This exquisite pair of volumes, bound in blue
morocco, was absolutely unimpaired, and was a sight to bring
happy tears into the eyes of the amateur of Elzevirs.&nbsp; There
was a gracious <i>svelte</i> elegance about these tomes, an
appealing and exquisite delicacy of proportion, that linger like
sweet music in the memory.&nbsp; I have a copy of the Wetstein
&lsquo;Marot&rsquo; myself, not a bad copy, though murderously
bound in that ecclesiastical sort of brown calf antique, which
goes well with hymn books, and reminds one of cakes of
chocolate.&nbsp; But my copy is only some 128 millimetres in
height, whereas the uncut Beckford copy (it had belonged to the
great Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court) was at least 130 millimetres
high.&nbsp; Beside the uncut example mine looks like
Cinderella&rsquo;s plain sister beside the beauty of the
family.</p>
<p>Now the moral is that only tall Elzevirs are beautiful, only
tall Elzevirs preserve their ancient proportions, only tall
Elzevirs are worth collecting.&nbsp; Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks
that the King of Lilliput was taller than any of his court by
almost the breadth of a nail, and that his altitude filled the
minds of all with awe.&nbsp; Well, the Philistine may think a few
millimetres, more or less, in the height of an Elzevir are of
little importance.&nbsp; When he comes to sell, he will discover
the difference.&nbsp; An uncut, or almost uncut, copy of a good
Elzevir may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more; an ordinary
copy may bring fewer pence.&nbsp; The binders usually pare down
the top and bottom more than the sides.&nbsp; I have a
&lsquo;Rabelais&rsquo; of the good date, with the red title
(1663), and some of the pages have never been opened, at the
sides.&nbsp; But the height is only some 122 millimetres, a mere
dwarf.&nbsp; Anything over 130 millimetres is very rare.&nbsp;
Therefore the collector of Elzevirs should have one of those
useful ivory-handled knives on which the French measures are
marked, and thus he will at once be able to satisfy himself as to
the exact height of any example which he encounters.</p>
<p>Let us now assume that the amateur quite understands what a
proper Elzevir should be: tall, clean, well bound if possible,
and of the good date.&nbsp; But we have still to learn what the
good dates are, and this is matter for the study and practice of
a well-spent life.&nbsp; We may gossip about a few of the more
famous Elzevirs, those without which no collection is
complete.&nbsp; Of all Elzevirs the most famous and the most
expensive is an old cookery book, &ldquo;&lsquo;Le Pastissier
Fran&ccedil;ois.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wherein is taught the way to make
all sorts of pastry, useful to all sorts of persons.&nbsp; Also
the manner of preparing all manner of eggs, for fast-days, and
other days, in more than sixty fashions.&nbsp; Amsterdam, Louys,
and Daniel Elsevier. 1665.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mark is not the old
&ldquo;Sage,&rdquo; but the &ldquo;Minerva&rdquo; with her
owl.&nbsp; Now this book has no intrinsic value any more than a
Tauchnitz reprint of any modern volume on cooking.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; is cherished because it is so very
rare.&nbsp; The tract passed into the hands of cooks, and the
hands of cooks are detrimental to literature.&nbsp; Just as
nursery books, fairy tales, and the like are destroyed from
generation to generation, so it happens with books used in the
kitchen.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Pastissier,&rsquo; to be sure, has a
good frontispiece, a scene in a Low Country kitchen, among the
dead game and the dainties.&nbsp; The buxom cook is making a game
pie; a pheasant pie, decorated with the bird&rsquo;s head and
tail-feathers, is already made. <a name="citation12"></a><a

</a></p>
<p>Not for these charms, but for its rarity, is the
&lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; coveted.&nbsp; In an early edition of
the &lsquo;Manuel&rsquo; (1821) Brunet says, with a feigned
brutality (for he dearly loved an Elzevir), &ldquo;Till now I
have disdained to admit this book into my work, but I have
yielded to the prayers of amateurs.&nbsp; Besides, how could I
keep out a volume which was sold for one hundred and one francs
in 1819?&rdquo;&nbsp; One hundred and one francs!&nbsp; If I
could only get a &lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; for one hundred and one
francs!&nbsp; But our grandfathers lived in the Bookman&rsquo;s
Paradise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;est pas jusqu&rsquo;aux
Anglais,&rdquo; adds Brunet&mdash;&ldquo;the very English
themselves&mdash;have a taste for the
&lsquo;Pastissier.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The Duke of
Marlborough&rsquo;s copy was actually sold for &pound;1 4s.&nbsp;
It would have been money in the ducal pockets of the house of
Marlborough to have kept this volume till the general sale of all
their portable property at which our generation is privileged to
assist.&nbsp; No wonder the &lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; was thought
rare.&nbsp; B&eacute;rard only knew two copies.&nbsp; Pietiers,
writing on the Elzevirs in 1843, could cite only five
&lsquo;Pastissiers,&rsquo; and in his &lsquo;Annales&rsquo; he
had found out but five more.&nbsp; Willems, on the other hand,
enumerates some thirty, not including Motteley&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Motteley was an uncultivated, untaught enthusiast.&nbsp; He knew
no Latin, but he had a <i>flair</i> for uncut Elzevirs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Incomptis capillis,&rdquo; he would cry (it was all his
lore) as he gloated over his treasures.&nbsp; They were all burnt
by the Commune in the Louvre Library.</p>
<p>A few examples may be given of the prices brought by &lsquo;Le
Pastissier&rsquo; in later days.&nbsp; Sensier&rsquo;s copy was
but 128 millimetres in height, and had the old ordinary vellum
binding,&mdash;in fact, it closely resembled a copy which Messrs.
Ellis and White had for sale in Bond Street in 1883.&nbsp; The
English booksellers asked, I think, about 1,500 francs for their
copy.&nbsp; Sensier&rsquo;s was sold for 128 francs in April,
1828; for 201 francs in 1837.&nbsp; Then the book was gloriously
bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, and was sold with Potier&rsquo;s books
in 1870, when it fetched 2,910 francs.&nbsp; At the Benzon sale
(1875) it fetched 3,255 francs, and, falling dreadfully in price,
was sold again in 1877 for 2,200 francs.&nbsp; M. Dutuit, at
Rouen, has a taller copy, bound by Bauzonnet.&nbsp; Last time it
was sold (1851) it brought 251 francs.&nbsp; The Duc de Chartres
has now the copy of Pieters, the historian of the Elzevirs,
valued at 3,000 francs.</p>
<p>About thirty years ago no fewer than three copies were sold at
Brighton, of all places.&nbsp; M. Quentin Bauchart had a copy
only 127 millimetres in height, which he swopped to M.
Paillet.&nbsp; M. Chartener, of Metz, had a copy now bound by
Bauzonnet which was sold for four francs in 1780.&nbsp; We call
this the age of cheap books, but before the Revolution books were
cheaper.&nbsp; It is fair to say, however, that this example of
the &lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; was then bound up with another book,
Vlacq&rsquo;s edition of &lsquo;Le Cuisinier
Fran&ccedil;ois,&rsquo; and so went cheaper than it would
otherwise have done.&nbsp; M. de Fontaine de Resbecq declares
that a friend of his bought six original pieces of
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s bound up with an old French translation of
Garth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dispensary.&rsquo;&nbsp; The one faint hope
left to the poor book collector is that he may find a valuable
tract lurking in the leaves of some bound collection of
trash.&nbsp; I have an original copy of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Les Fascheux&rsquo; bound up with a treatise on precious
stones, but the bookseller from whom I bought it knew it was
there!&nbsp; That made all the difference.</p>
<p>But, to return to our &lsquo;Pastissier,&rsquo; here is M. de
Fontaine de Resbecq&rsquo;s account of how he wooed and won his
own copy of this illustrious Elzevir.&nbsp; &ldquo;I began my
walk to-day,&rdquo; says this haunter of ancient stalls,
&ldquo;by the Pont Marie and the Quai de la Gr&egrave;ve, the
pillars of Hercules of the book-hunting world.&nbsp; After having
viewed and reviewed these remote books, I was going away, when my
attention was caught by a small naked volume, without a stitch of
binding.&nbsp; I seized it, and what was my delight when I
recognised one of the rarest of that famed Elzevir collection
whose height is measured as minutely as the carats of the
diamond.&nbsp; There was no indication of price on the box where
this jewel was lying; the book, though unbound, was perfectly
clean within.&nbsp; &lsquo;How much?&rsquo; said I to the
bookseller.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can have it for six sous,&rsquo; he
answered; &lsquo;is it too much?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the thirty centimes
he asked for the &lsquo;Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ois.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You may believe, my friend, that after such a piece of luck at
the start, one goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of
one&rsquo;s search.&nbsp; That is exactly what I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can this tale be true?&nbsp; Is such luck given by the jealous
fates <i>mortalibus &aelig;gris</i>?&nbsp; M. de Resbecq&rsquo;s
find was made apparently in 1856, when trout were plenty in the
streams, and rare books not so very rare.&nbsp; To my own
knowledge an English collector has bought an original play of
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s, in the original vellum, for
eighteenpence.&nbsp; But no one has such luck any longer.&nbsp;
Not, at least, in London.&nbsp; A more expensive
&lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; than that which brought six sous was
priced in Bachelin-Deflorenne&rsquo;s catalogue at
&pound;240.&nbsp; A curious thing occurred when two uncut
&lsquo;Pastissiers&rsquo; turned up simultaneously in
Paris.&nbsp; One of them Morgand and Fatout sold for
&pound;400.&nbsp; Clever people argued that one of the twin uncut
&lsquo;Pastissiers&rsquo; must be an imitation, a facsimile by
means of photogravure, or some other process.&nbsp; But it was
triumphantly established that both were genuine; they had minute
points of difference in the ornaments.</p>
<p>M. Willems, the learned historian of the Elzevirs, is
indignant at the successes of a book which, as Brunet declares,
is badly printed.&nbsp; There must be at least forty known
&lsquo;Pastissiers&rsquo; in the world.&nbsp; Yes; but there are
at least 4,000 people who would greatly rejoice to possess a
&lsquo;Pastissier,&rsquo; and some of these desirous ones are
very wealthy.&nbsp; While this state of the market endures, the
&lsquo;Pastissier&rsquo; will fetch higher prices than the other
varieties.&nbsp; Another extremely rare Elzevir is
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Illustre Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Mons.
Corneille&rsquo; (Leyden, 1644).&nbsp; This contains &lsquo;Le
Cid,&rsquo; &lsquo;Les Horaces,&rsquo; &lsquo;Le Cinna,&rsquo;
&lsquo;La Mort de Pomp&eacute;e,&rsquo; &lsquo;Le
Polyeucte.&rsquo;&nbsp; The name, &lsquo;L&rsquo;Illustre
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre,&rsquo; appearing at that date has an
interest of its own.&nbsp; In 1643&ndash;44, Moli&egrave;re and
Madeleine B&eacute;jart had just started the company which they
called &lsquo;L&rsquo;Illustre Th&eacute;&acirc;tre.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Only six or seven copies of the book are actually known, though
three or four are believed to exist in England, probably all
covered with dust in the library of some lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
has a very good library,&rdquo; I once heard some one say to a
noble earl, whose own library was famous.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
can a fellow do with a very good library?&rdquo; answered the
descendant of the Crusaders, who probably (being a youth
light-hearted and content) was ignorant of his own great
possessions.&nbsp; An expensive copy of &lsquo;L&rsquo;Illustre
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre,&rsquo; bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, was sold
for &pound;300.</p>
<p>Among Elzevirs desirable, yet not hopelessly rare, is the
&lsquo;Virgil&rsquo; of 1636.&nbsp; Heinsius was the editor of
this beautiful volume, prettily printed, but incorrect.&nbsp;
Probably it is hard to correct with absolute accuracy works in
the clear but minute type which the Elzevirs affected.&nbsp; They
have won fame by the elegance of their books, but their intention
was to sell good books cheap, like Michel L&eacute;vy.&nbsp; The
small type was required to get plenty of &ldquo;copy&rdquo; into
little bulk.&nbsp; Nicholas Heinsius, the son of the editor of
the &lsquo;Virgil,&rsquo; when he came to correct his
father&rsquo;s edition, found that it contained so many
coquilles, or misprints, as to be nearly the most incorrect copy
in the world.&nbsp; Heyne says, &ldquo;Let the
&lsquo;Virgil&rsquo; be one of the rare Elzevirs, if you please,
but within it has scarcely a trace of any good
quality.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the first edition of this beautiful
little book, with its two passages of red letters, is so
desirable that, till he could possess it, Charles Nodier would
not profane his shelves by any &lsquo;Virgil&rsquo; at all.</p>
<p>Equally fine is the &lsquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo; of 1635, which,
with the &lsquo;Virgil&rsquo; of 1636 and the
&lsquo;Imitation&rsquo; without date, M. Willems thinks the most
successful works of the Elzevirs, &ldquo;one of the most enviable
jewels in the casket of the bibliophile.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be
recognised by the page 238, which is erroneously printed
248.&nbsp; A good average height is from 125 to 128
millimetres.&nbsp; The highest known is 130 millimetres.&nbsp;
This book, like the &lsquo;Imitation,&rsquo; has one of the
pretty and ingenious frontispieces which the Elzevirs prefixed to
their books.&nbsp; So farewell, and good speed in your sport, ye
hunters of Elzevirs, and may you find perhaps the rarest Elzevir
of all, &lsquo;L&rsquo;Aimable M&egrave;re de
J&eacute;sus.&rsquo;</p>

20</span><i>CURIOSITIES OF PARISH REGISTERS</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are three classes of persons
who are deeply concerned with parish registers&mdash;namely,
villains, antiquaries, and the sedulous readers, &ldquo;parish
clerks and others,&rdquo; of the second or &ldquo;agony&rdquo;
column of the Times.&nbsp; Villains are probably the most
numerous of these three classes.&nbsp; The villain of fiction
dearly loves a parish register: he cuts out pages, inserts
others, intercalates remarks in a different coloured ink, and
generally manipulates the register as a Greek manages his hand at
<i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>, or as a Hebrew dealer in Moabite
bric-&agrave;-brac treats a synagogue roll.&nbsp; We well
remember one villain who had locked himself into the vestry (he
was disguised as an arch&aelig;ologist), and who was enjoying his
wicked pleasure with the register, when the vestry somehow caught
fire, the rusty key would not turn in the door, and the villain
was roasted alive, in spite of the disinterested efforts to save
him made by all the virtuous characters in the story.&nbsp; Let
the fate of this bold, bad man be a warning to wicked earls,
baronets, and all others who attempt to destroy the record of the
marriage of a hero&rsquo;s parents.&nbsp; Fate will be too strong
for them in the long run, though they bribe the parish clerk, or
carry off in white wax an impression of the keys of the vestry
and of the iron chest in which a register should repose.</p>
<p>There is another and more prosaic danger in the way of
villains, if the new bill, entitled &ldquo;The Parish Registers
Preservation Act,&rdquo; ever becomes law.&nbsp; The bill
provides that every register earlier than 1837 shall be committed
to the care of the Master of the Rolls, and removed to the Record
Office.&nbsp; Now the common villain of fiction would feel sadly
out of place in the Register Office, where a more watchful eye
than that of a comic parish clerk would be kept on his
proceedings.&nbsp; Villains and local antiquaries will,
therefore, use all their parliamentary influence to oppose and
delay this bill, which is certainly hard on the parish
arch&aelig;ologist.&nbsp; The men who grub in their local
registers, and slowly compile parish or county history, deserve
to be encouraged rather than depressed.&nbsp; Mr. Chester Waters,
therefore, has suggested that copies of registers should be made,
and the comparatively legible copy left in the parish, while the
crabbed original is conveyed to the Record Office in
London.&nbsp; Thus the local antiquary would really have his work
made more easy for him (though it may be doubted whether he would
quite enjoy that condescension), while the villain of romance
would be foiled; for it is useless (as a novel of Mr. Christie
Murray&rsquo;s proves) to alter the register in the keeping of
the parish when the original document is safe in the Record
Office.&nbsp; But previous examples of enforced transcription (as
in 1603) do not encourage us to suppose that the copies would be
very scrupulously made.&nbsp; Thus, after the Reformation, the
prayers for the dead in the old registers were omitted by the
copyist, who seemed to think (as the contractor for
&ldquo;sandwich men&rdquo; said to the poor fellows who carried
the letter H), &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you, and the public
don&rsquo;t want you, and you&rsquo;re no use to
nobody.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, when Laurence Fletcher was buried in
St. Saviour&rsquo;s, Southwark, in 1608, the old register
described him as &ldquo;a player, the King&rsquo;s
servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the clerk, keeping a note-book, simply
called Laurence Fletcher &ldquo;a man,&rdquo; and (in 1625) he
also styled Mr. John Fletcher &ldquo;a man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, the
old register calls Mr. John Fletcher &ldquo;a poet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To copy all the parish registers in England would be a very
serious task, and would probably be but slovenly performed.&nbsp;
If they were reproduced, again, by any process of photography,
the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as ever.&nbsp;
But this is a minor objection, for the local antiquary revels in
the old court hand.</p>
<p>From the little volume by Mr. Chester Waters, already referred
to (&lsquo;Parish Registers in England;&rsquo; printed for the
author by F. J. Roberts, Little Britain, E.C.), we proceed to
appropriate such matters of curiosity as may interest minds
neither parochial nor doggedly antiquarian.&nbsp; Parish
registers among the civilised peoples of antiquity do not greatly
concern us.&nbsp; It seems certain that many Polynesian races
have managed to record (in verse, or by some rude marks) the
genealogies of their chiefs through many hundreds of years.&nbsp;
These oral registers are accepted as fairly truthful by some
students, yet we must remember that Pindar supposed himself to
possess knowledge of at least twenty-five generations before his
own time, and that only brought him up to the birth of
Jason.&nbsp; Nobody believes in Jason and Medea, and possibly the
genealogical records of Maoris and Fijians are as little
trustworthy as those of Pindaric Greece.&nbsp; However, to
consider thus is to consider too curiously.&nbsp; We only know
for certain that genealogy very soon becomes important, and,
therefore, that records are early kept, in a growing
civilisation.&nbsp; &ldquo;After Nehemiah&rsquo;s return from the
captivity in Babylon, the priests at Jerusalem whose register was
not found were as polluted put from the priesthood.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rome had her parish registers, which were kept in the temple of
Saturn.&nbsp; But modern parish registers were
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; (like America) in 1497, when Cardinal
Ximenes found it desirable to put on record the names of the
godfathers and godmothers of baptised children.&nbsp; When these
relations of &ldquo;gossip,&rdquo; or God&rsquo;s kin (as the
word literally means), were not certainly known, married persons
could easily obtain divorces, by pretending previous spiritual
relationship.</p>
<p>But it was only during the reign of Mary, (called the Bloody)
that this rule of registering godfathers and godmothers prevailed
in England.&nbsp; Henry VIII. introduced the custom of parish
registers when in a Protestant humour.&nbsp; By the way, how
curiously has Madame de Flamareil (la femme de quarante ans, in
Charles de Bernard&rsquo;s novel) anticipated the verdict of Mr.
Froude on Henry VIII.!&nbsp; &lsquo;On accuse Henri VIII.,&rsquo;
dit Madame de Flamareil, &ldquo;moi je le comprends, et je
l&rsquo;absous; c&rsquo;&eacute;tait un c&oelig;ur
g&eacute;n&eacute;reux, lorsqu&rsquo;il ne les aimait plus, il
les tuait.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The public of England mistrusted,
in the matter of parish registers, the generous heart of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; It is the fixed conviction of the public that all
novelties in administration mean new taxes.&nbsp; Thus the
Croatian peasantry were once on the point of revolting because
they imagined that they were to be taxed in proportion to the
length of their moustaches.&nbsp; The English believed, and the
insurgents of the famous Pilgrimage of Grace declared, that
baptism was to be refused to all children who did not pay a
&ldquo;trybette&rdquo; (tribute) to the king.&nbsp; But Henry, or
rather his minister, Cromwell, stuck to his plan, and (September
29, 1538) issued an injunction that a weekly register of
weddings, christenings, and burials should be kept by the curate
of every parish.&nbsp; The cost of the book (twopence in the case
of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster) was defrayed by the
parishioners.&nbsp; The oldest extant register books are those
thus acquired in 1597 or 1603.&nbsp; These volumes were of
parchment, and entries were copied into them out of the old books
on paper.&nbsp; The copyists, as we have seen, were indolent, and
omitted characteristic points in the more ancient records.</p>
<p>In the civil war parish registers fell into some confusion,
and when the clergy did make entries they commonly expressed
their political feelings in a mixture of Latin and English.&nbsp;
Latin, by the way, went out as Protestantism came in, but the
curate of Rotherby, in Leicestershire, writes, &ldquo;Bellum,
Bellum, Bellum, interruption! persecution!&rdquo;&nbsp; At St.
Bridget&rsquo;s, in Chester, is the quaint entry,
&ldquo;1643.&nbsp; Here the register is defective till
1653.&nbsp; The tymes were <i>such</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; At Hilton,
in Dorset, William Snoke, minister, entered his opinion that
persons whose baptism and marriage were not registered
&ldquo;will be made uncapable of any earthly inheritance if they
live.&nbsp; This I note for the satisfaction of any that
do:&rdquo; though we may doubt whether these parishioners found
the information thus conveyed highly satisfactory.</p>
<p>The register of Maid&rsquo;s Moreton, Bucks, tells how the
reading-desk (a spread eagle, gilt) was &ldquo;doomed to perish
as an abominable idoll;&rdquo; and how the cross on the steeple
nearly (but not quite) knocked out the brains of the Puritan who
removed it.&nbsp; The Puritans had their way with the registers
as well as with the eagle (&ldquo;the vowl,&rdquo; as the old
country people call it), and laymen took the place of parsons as
registrars in 1653.&nbsp; The books from 1653 to 1660, while this
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> lasted, &ldquo;were kept exceptionally
well,&rdquo; new brooms sweeping clean.&nbsp; The books of the
period contain fewer of the old Puritan Christian names than we
might have expected.&nbsp; We find, &ldquo;<i>Repente</i>
Kytchens,&rdquo; so styled before the poor little thing had
anything but original sin to repent of.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Faint
not</i> Kennard&rdquo; is also registered, and
&ldquo;<i>Freegift</i> Mabbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A novelty was introduced into registers in 1678.&nbsp; The law
required (for purposes of protecting trade) that all the dead
should be buried in woollen winding-sheets.&nbsp; The price of
the wool was the obolus paid to the Charon of the Revenue.&nbsp;
After March 25, 1667, no person was to be &ldquo;buried in any
shirt, shift, or sheet other that should be made of woole
only.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus when the children in a little Oxfordshire
village lately beheld a ghost, &ldquo;dressed in a long narrow
gown of woollen, with bandages round the head and chin,&rdquo; it
is clear that the ghost was much more than a hundred years old,
for the act &ldquo;had fallen into disuse long before it was
repealed in 1814.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this has little to do with
parish registers.&nbsp; The addition made to the duties of the
keeper of the register in 1678 was this&mdash;he had to take and
record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead, to the effect that
the corpse was actually buried in woollen fabric.&nbsp; The upper
classes, however, preferred to bury in linen, and to pay the fine
of 5<i>l</i>.&nbsp; When Mistress Oldfield, the famous actress,
was interred in 1730, her body was arrayed &ldquo;in a very fine
Brussels lace headdress, a holland shift with a tucker and double
ruffles of the same lace, and a pair of new kid
gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1694 an empty exchequer was replenished by a tax on
marriages, births, and burials, the very extortion which had been
feared by the insurgents in the Pilgrimage of Grace.&nbsp; The
tax collectors had access without payment of fee to the
registers.&nbsp; The registration of births was discontinued when
the Taxation Acts expired.&nbsp; An attempt to introduce the
registration of births was made in 1753, but
unsuccessfully.&nbsp; The public had the old superstitious dread
of anything like a census.&nbsp; Moreover, the custom was
denounced as &ldquo;French,&rdquo; and therefore
abominable.&nbsp; In the same way it was thought telling to call
the <i>cl&ocirc;ture</i> &ldquo;the French gag&rdquo; during some
recent discussions of parliamentary rules.&nbsp; In 1783 the
parish register was again made the instrument of taxation, and
threepence was charged on every entry.&nbsp; Thus &ldquo;the
clergyman was placed in the invidious light of a tax collector,
and as the poor were often unable or unwilling to pay the tax,
the clergy had a direct inducement to retain their good-will by
keeping the registers defective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine the indignation in Scotland when
&ldquo;bang went saxpence&rdquo; every time a poor man had
twins!&nbsp; Of course the Scotch rose up against this
unparalleled extortion.&nbsp; At last, in 1812,
&ldquo;Rose&rsquo;s Act&rdquo; was passed.&nbsp; It is styled
&ldquo;an Act for the better regulating and preserving registers
of births,&rdquo; but the registration of births is altogether
omitted from its provisions.&nbsp; By a stroke of the wildest wit
the penalty of transportation for fourteen years, for making a
false entry, &ldquo;is to be divided equally between the informer
and the poor of the parish.&rdquo;&nbsp; A more casual Act has
rarely been drafted.</p>
<p>Without entering into the modern history of parish registers,
we may borrow a few of the ancient curiosities to be found
therein, the blunders and the waggeries of forgotten priests, and
curates, and parish clerks.&nbsp; In quite recent times (1832) it
was thought worth while to record that Charity Morrell at her
wedding had signed her name in the register with her right foot,
and that the ring had been placed on the fourth toe of her left
foot; for poor Charity was born without arms.&nbsp; Sometimes the
time of a birth was recorded with much minuteness, that the
astrologers might draw a more accurate horoscope.&nbsp; Unlucky
children, with no acknowledged fathers, were entered in a variety
of odd ways.&nbsp; In Lambeth (1685), George Speedwell is put
down as &ldquo;a merry begot;&rdquo; Anne Twine is
&ldquo;<i>filia uniuscujusque</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Croydon, a
certain William is &ldquo;terraefilius&rdquo; (1582), an
autochthonous infant.&nbsp; Among the queer names of foundlings
are &ldquo;Nameless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Godsend,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Subpoena,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Moyses and Aaron, two children
found,&rdquo; not in the bulrushes, but &ldquo;in the
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rule was to give the foundling for surname the name of the
parish, and from the Temple Church came no fewer than one hundred
and four foundlings named &ldquo;Temple,&rdquo; between 1728 and
1755.&nbsp; These Temples are the plebeian <i>gens</i> of the
patrician house which claims descent from Godiva.&nbsp; The use
of surnames as Christian names is later than the Reformation, and
is the result of a reaction against the exclusive use of
saints&rsquo; names from the calendar.&nbsp; Another example of
the same reaction is the use of Old Testament names, and
&ldquo;Ananias and Sapphira were favourite names with the
Presbyterians.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is only fair to add that these
names are no longer popular with Presbyterians, at any rate in
the Kirk of Scotland.&nbsp; The old Puritan argument was that you
would hardly select the name of too notorious a scriptural
sinner, &ldquo;as bearing testimony to the triumph of grace over
original sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in America a clergyman has been
known to decline to christen a child &ldquo;Pontius
Pilate,&rdquo; and no wonder.</p>
<p>Entries of burials in ancient times often contained some
biographical information about the deceased.&nbsp; But nothing
could possibly be vaguer than this: &ldquo;1615, February 28, St.
Martin&rsquo;s, Ludgate, was buried an anatomy from the College
of Physicians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man, woman, or child, sinner or
saint, we know not, only that &ldquo;an anatomy&rdquo; found
Christian burial in St. Martin&rsquo;s, Ludgate.&nbsp; How much
more full and characteristic is this, from St.
Peter&rsquo;s-in-the-East, Oxford (1568): &lsquo;There was buried
Alyce, the wiff of a naughty fellow whose name is Matthew
Manne.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is immortality for Matthew Manne, and
there is, in short-hand, the tragedy of &ldquo;Alyce his
wiff.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reader of this record knows more of
Matthew than in two hundred years any one is likely to know of us
who moralise over Matthew!&nbsp; At Kyloe, in Northumberland, the
intellectual defects of Henry Watson have, like the naughtiness
of Manne, secured him a measure of fame. (1696.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Henry was so great a fooll, that he never could put on his
own close, nor never went a quarter of a mile off the
house,&rdquo; as Voltaire&rsquo;s Memnon resolved never to do,
and as Pascal partly recommends.</p>
<p>What had Mary Woodfield done to deserve the alias which the
Croydon register gives her of &ldquo;Queen of Hell&rdquo;?
(1788.)&nbsp; Distinguished people were buried in effigy, in all
the different churches with which they were connected, and each
sham burial service was entered in the parish registers, a snare
and stumbling-block to the historian.&nbsp; This curious custom
is very ancient.&nbsp; Thus we read in the Odyssey that when
Menelaus heard in Egypt of the death of Agamemnon he reared for
him a cenotaph, and piled an empty barrow &ldquo;that the fame of
the dead man might never be quenched.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably this
old usage gave rise to the claims of several Greek cities to
possess the tomb of this or that ancient hero.&nbsp; A heroic
tomb, as of Cassandra for example, several towns had to show, but
which was the true grave, which were the cenotaphs?&nbsp; Queen
Elizabeth was buried in all the London churches, and poor
Cassandra had her barrow in Argos, Mycen&aelig;, and
Amycl&aelig;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A drynkyng for the soul&rdquo; of the dead, a
&tau;&#8049;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf; or funeral feast, was as
common in England before the Reformation as in ancient
Greece.&nbsp; James Cooke, of Sporle, in Norfolk (1528), left six
shillings and eightpence to pay for this &ldquo;drynkyng for his
soul;&rdquo; and the funeral feast, which long survived in the
distribution of wine, wafers, and rosemary, still endures as a
slight collation of wine and cake in Scotland.&nbsp; What a
funeral could be, as late as 1731, Mr. Chester Waters proves by
the bill for the burial of Andrew Card, senior bencher of
Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; The deceased was brave in a
&ldquo;superfine pinked shroud&rdquo; (cheap at 1<i>l</i>.
5<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.), and there were eight large plate
candle-sticks on stands round the da&iuml;s, and ninety-six
buckram escutcheons.&nbsp; The pall-bearers wore Alamode hatbands
covered with frizances, and so did the divines who were present
at the melancholy but gorgeous function.&nbsp; A hundred men in
mourning carried a hundred white wax branch lights, and the
gloves of the porters in Gray&rsquo;s Inn were ash-coloured with
black points.&nbsp; Yet the wine cost no more than 1<i>l</i>.
19<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; a &ldquo;deal of sack,&rdquo; by no means
&ldquo;intolerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the funerals, we find that the parish register
sometimes records ancient and obsolete modes of death.&nbsp;
Thus, martyrs are scarce now, but the register of All
Saints&rsquo;, Derby, 1556, mentions &ldquo;a poor blinde woman
called Joan Waste, of this parish, a martyr, burned in Windmill
pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was condemned by Ralph Baynes, Bishop of
Coventry and Lichfield.&nbsp; In 1558, at Richmond, in Yorkshire,
we find &ldquo;Richard Snell, b&rsquo;rnt, bur. 9
Sept.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Croydon, in 1585, Roger Shepherd probably
never expected to be eaten by a lioness.&nbsp; Roger was not,
like Wyllyam Barker, &ldquo;a common drunkard and
blasphemer,&rdquo; and we cannot regard the Croydon lioness, like
the Nemean lion, as a miraculous monster sent against the county
of Surrey for the sins of the people.&nbsp; The lioness
&ldquo;was brought into the town to be seen of such as would give
money to see her.&nbsp; He&rdquo; (Roger) &ldquo;was sore wounded
in sundry places, and was buried the 26th Aug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1590, the register of St. Oswald&rsquo;s, Durham, informs
us that &ldquo;Duke, Hyll, Hogge, and Holiday&rdquo; were hanged
and burned for &ldquo;there horrible offences.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
arm of one of these horrible offenders was preserved at St. Omer
as the relic of a martyr, &ldquo;a most precious treasure,&rdquo;
in 1686.&nbsp; But no one knew whether the arm belonged
originally to Holiday, Hyll, Duke, or Hogge.&nbsp; The coals,
when these unfortunate men were burned, cost sixpence; the other
items in the account of the abominable execution are, perhaps,
too repulsive to be quoted.</p>
<p>According to some critics of the British government, we do not
treat the Egyptians well.&nbsp; But our conduct towards the
Fellahs has certainly improved since this entry was made in the
register of St. Nicholas, Durham (1592, August 8th):
&lsquo;Simson, Arington, Featherston, Fenwick, and Lancaster,
<i>were hanged for being Egyptians</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were,
in fact, gypsies, or had been consorting with gypsies, and they
suffered under 5 Eliz. c. 20.&nbsp; In 1783 this statute was
abolished, and was even considered &ldquo;a law of excessive
severity.&rdquo;&nbsp; For even a hundred years ago &ldquo;the
puling cant of sickly humanitarianism&rdquo; was making itself
heard to the injury of our sturdy old English legislation.&nbsp;
To be killed by a poet is now an unusual fate, but the St.
Leonard&rsquo;s, Shoreditch, register (1598) mentions how
&ldquo;Gabriel Spencer, being slayne, was buried.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gabriel was &ldquo;slayne&rdquo; by Rare Ben Jonson, in Hoxton
Fields.</p>
<p>The burning of witches is, naturally, not an uncommon item in
parish registers, and is set forth in a bold, business-like
manner.&nbsp; On August 21 (1650) fifteen women and one man were
executed for the imaginary crime of witchcraft.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
grave, for a witch, sixpence,&rdquo; is an item in the municipal
accounts.&nbsp; And the grave was a cheap haven for the poor
woman who had been committed to the tender mercies of a Scotch
witch-trier.&nbsp; Cetewayo&rsquo;s medicine-men, who
&ldquo;smelt out&rdquo; witches, were only some two centuries in
the rear of our civilisation.&nbsp; Three hundred years ago
Bishop Jewell, preaching before Elizabeth, was quite of the mind
of Cetewayo and Saul, as to the wickedness of suffering a witch
to live.&nbsp; As late as 1691, the register of Holy Island,
Northumberland, mentions &ldquo;William Cleugh, bewitched to
death,&rdquo; and the superstition is almost as powerful as ever
among the rural people.&nbsp; Between July 13 and July 24 (1699)
the widow Comon, in Essex, was thrice swum for a witch.&nbsp; She
was not drowned, but survived her immersion for only five
months.&nbsp; A singular homicide is recorded at Newington Butts,
1689.&nbsp; &ldquo;John Arris and Derwick Farlin in one grave,
being both Dutch soldiers; one killed the other drinking
brandy.&rdquo;&nbsp; But who slew the slayer?&nbsp; The register
is silent; but &ldquo;often eating a shoulder of mutton or a peck
of hasty pudding at a time caused the death of James
Parsons,&rdquo; at Teddington, in Middlesex, 1743.&nbsp; Parsons
had resisted the effects of shoulders of mutton and hasty pudding
till the age of thirty-six.</p>
<p>And so the registers run on.&nbsp; Sometimes they tell of the
death of a glutton, sometimes of a <i>Grace wyfe</i> (grosse
femme).&nbsp; Now the bell tolls for the decease of a duke, now
of a &ldquo;dog-whipper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lutenists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Saltpetremen&rdquo;&mdash;the skeleton of the old German
allegory whispers to each and twitches him by the sleeve.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ellis Thompson, <i>insipiens</i>,&rdquo; leaves
Chester-le-Street, where he had gabbled and scrabbled on the
doors, and follows &ldquo;William, foole to my Lady
Jerningham,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Edward Errington, the Towne&rsquo;s
Fooll&rdquo; (Newcastle-on-Tyne) down the way to dusty
death.&nbsp; Edward Errington died &ldquo;of the pest,&rdquo; and
another idiot took his place and office, for Newcastle had her
regular town fools before she acquired her singularly advanced
modern representatives.&nbsp; The &ldquo;aquavity man&rdquo; dies
(in Cripplegate), and the &ldquo;dumb-man who was a
fortune-teller&rdquo; (Stepney, 1628), and the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Falkner,&rdquo; and Mr. Gregory Isham, who
combined the professions, not frequently united, of
&ldquo;attorney and husbandman,&rdquo; in Barwell, Leicestershire
(1655).&nbsp; &ldquo;The lame chimney-sweeper,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;King of the gypsies,&rdquo; and Alexander Willis,
&ldquo;qui calographiam docuit,&rdquo; the linguist, and the Tom
o&rsquo; Bedlam, the comfit-maker, and the panyer-man, and the
tack-maker, and the suicide, they all found death; or, if they
sought him, the churchyard where they were &ldquo;hurled into a
grave&rdquo; was interdicted, and purified, after a fortnight,
with &ldquo;frankincense and sweet perfumes, and
herbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes people died wholesale of pestilence, and the
Longborough register mentions a fresh way of death, &ldquo;the
swat called New Acquaintance, alias Stoupe Knave, and know thy
master.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another malady was &lsquo;the posting swet,
that posted from towne to towne through England.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
plague of 1591 was imported in bales of cloth from the Levant,
just as British commerce still patriotically tries to introduce
cholera in cargoes of Egyptian rags.&nbsp; The register of
Malpas, in Cheshire (Aug. 24, 1625), has this strange story of
the plague:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard Dawson being sicke of the plague, and
perceiving he must die at yt time, arose out of his bed, and made
his grave, and caused his nefew, John Dawson, to cast strawe into
the grave which was not farre from the house, and went and
lay&rsquo;d him down in the say&rsquo;d grave, and caused clothes
to be lay&rsquo;d uppon and so dep&rsquo;ted out of this world;
this he did because he was a strong man, and heavier than his
said nefew and another wench were able to bury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And John Dawson died, and Rose Smyth, the &ldquo;wench&rdquo;
already spoken of, died, the last of the household.</p>
<p>Old customs survive in the parish registers.&nbsp; Scolding
wives were ducked, and in Kingston-on-Thames, 1572, the register
tells how the sexton&rsquo;s wife &ldquo;was sett on a new
cukking-stoole, and brought to Temes brydge, and there had three
duckings over head and eres, because she was a common scold and
fighter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cucking-stool, a very elaborate engine
of the law, cost 1<i>l</i>. 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.&nbsp; Men were
ducked for beating their wives, and if that custom were revived
the profession of cucking-stool maker would become busy and
lucrative.&nbsp; Penances of a graver sort are on record in the
registers.&nbsp; Margaret Sherioux, in Croydon (1597), was
ordered to stand three market days in the town, and three Sundays
in the church, in a white sheet.&nbsp; The sin imputed to her was
a dreadful one.&nbsp; &ldquo;She stood one Saturday, and one
Sunday, and died the next.&rdquo;&nbsp; Innocent or guilty, this
world was no longer a fit abiding-place for Margaret
Sherioux.&nbsp; Occasionally the keeper of the register entered
any event which seemed out of the common.&nbsp; Thus the register
of St. Nicholas, Durham (1568), has this contribution to natural
history:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certaine Italian brought into the cittie of Durham a
very greate strange and monstrous serpent, in length sixteen
feet, in quantitie and dimentions greater than a greate horse,
which was taken and killed by special policie, in Ethiopia within
the Turkas dominions.&nbsp; But before it was killed, it had
devoured (as is credibly thought) more than 1,000 persons, and
destroyed a great country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This must have been a descendant of the monster that would
have eaten Andromeda, and was slain by Perseus in the country of
the blameless Ethiopians.&nbsp; Collections of money are recorded
occasionally, as in 1680, when no less than one pound eight
shillings was contributed &ldquo;for redemption of Christians
(taken by ye Turkish pyrates) out of Turkish
slavery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two hundred years ago the Turk was pretty
&ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo; still.&nbsp; Of all blundering
Dogberries, the most confused kept (in 1670) the parish register
at Melton Mowbray:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here [he writes] is a bill of Burton Lazareth&rsquo;s
people, which was buried, and which was and maried above 10 years
old, for because the clarke was dead, and therefore they was not
set down according as they was, but they all set down sure enough
one among another here in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all set down sure enough,&rdquo; nor does it
matter much now to know whom they married, and how long they
lived in Melton Mowbray.&nbsp; The following entry sufficed for
the great Villiers that expired &ldquo;in the worst inn&rsquo;s
worst room,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Kirkby Moorside, Yorkshire,
1687.&nbsp; Georges vilaris Lord dooke of Bookingham, bur. 17.
April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for Buckingham!&rdquo;</p>

40</span><i>SOME JAPANESE BOGIE-BOOKS</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is or used to be a poem for
infant minds of a rather Pharisaical character, which was popular
in the nursery when I was a youngster.&nbsp; It ran something
like this:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">I thank my stars that I was born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A little British child.</p>
<p>Perhaps these were not the very words, but that was decidedly
the sentiment.&nbsp; Look at the Japanese infants, from the
pencil of the famous Hokusai.&nbsp; Though they are not British,
were there ever two jollier, happier small creatures?&nbsp; Did
Leech, or Mr. Du Maurier, or Andrea della Robbia ever present a
more delightful view of innocent, well-pleased childhood?&nbsp;
Well, these Japanese children, if they are in the least inclined
to be timid or nervous, must have an awful time of it at night in
the dark, and when they make that eerie &ldquo;northwest
passage&rdquo; bedwards through the darkling house of which Mr.
Stevenson sings the perils and the emotions.&nbsp; All of us who
did not suffer under parents brought up on the views of Mr.
Herbert Spencer have endured, in childhood, a good deal from
ghosts.&nbsp; But it is nothing to what Japanese children bear,
for our ghosts are to the spectres of Japan as moonlight is to
sunlight, or as water unto whisky.&nbsp; Personally I may say
that few people have been plagued by the terror that walketh in
darkness more than myself.&nbsp; At the early age of ten I had
the tales of the ingenious Mr. Edgar Poe and of Charlotte
Bront&euml; &ldquo;put into my hands&rdquo; by a cousin who had
served as a Bashi Bazouk, and knew not the meaning of fear.&nbsp;
But I <i>did</i>, and perhaps even Nelson would have found out
&ldquo;what fear was,&rdquo; or the boy in the Norse tale would
have &ldquo;learned to shiver,&rdquo; if he had been left alone
to peruse &lsquo;Jane Eyre,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Black
Cat,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Fall of the House of Usher,&rsquo; as
I was.&nbsp; Every night I expected to wake up in my coffin,
having been prematurely buried; or to hear sighs in the area,
followed by light, unsteady footsteps on the stairs, and then to
see a lady all in a white shroud stained with blood and clay
stagger into my room, the victim of too rapid interment.&nbsp; As
to the notion that my respected kinsman had a mad wife concealed
on the premises, and that a lunatic aunt, black in the face with
suppressed mania, would burst into my chamber, it was
comparatively a harmless fancy, and not particularly
disturbing.&nbsp; Between these and the &lsquo;Yellow
Dwarf,&rsquo; who (though only the invention of the Countess
D&rsquo;Aulnoy) might frighten a nervous infant into hysterics, I
personally had as bad a time of it in the night watches as any
happy British child has survived.&nbsp; But our ogres are nothing
to the bogies which make not only night but day terrible to the
studious infants of Japan and China.</p>

<p>Chinese ghosts are probably much the same as Japanese
ghosts.&nbsp; The Japanese have borrowed most things, including
apparitions and awesome sprites and grisly fiends, from the
Chinese, and then have improved on the original model.&nbsp; Now
we have a very full, complete, and horror-striking account of
Chinese <i>harnts</i> (as the country people in Tennessee call
them) from Mr. Herbert Giles, who has translated scores of
Chinese ghost stories in his &lsquo;Strange Tales from a Chinese
Studio&rsquo; (De la Rue, 1880).&nbsp; Mr. Giles&rsquo;s volumes
prove that China is the place for Messrs. Gurney and Myers, the
secretaries of the Psychical Society.</p>
<p>Ghosts do not live a hole-and-corner life in China, but boldly
come out and take their part in the pleasures and business of
life.&nbsp; It has always been a question with me whether ghosts,
in a haunted house, appear when there is no audience.&nbsp; What
does the spectre in the tapestried chamber do when the house is
<i>not</i> full, and no guest is put in the room to bury
strangers in, the haunted room?&nbsp; Does the ghost sulk and
complain that there is &ldquo;no house,&rdquo; and refuse to
rehearse his little performance, in a conscientious and
disinterestedly artistic spirit, when deprived of the
artist&rsquo;s true pleasure, the awakening of sympathetic
emotion in the mind of the spectator?&nbsp; We give too little
thought and sympathy to ghosts, who in our old castles and
country houses often find no one to appear to from year&rsquo;s
end to year&rsquo;s-end.&nbsp; Only now and then is a guest
placed in the &ldquo;haunted room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I like to
fancy the glee of the lady in green or the radiant boy, or the
headless man, or the old gentleman in snuff-coloured clothes, as
he, or she, recognises the presence of a spectator, and prepares
to give his or her best effects in the familiar style.</p>
<p>Now in China and Japan certainly a ghost does not wait till
people enter the haunted room: a ghost, like a person of fashion,
&ldquo;goes everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, he has this
artistic excellence, that very often you don&rsquo;t know him
from an embodied person.&nbsp; He counterfeits mortality so
cleverly that he (the ghost) has been known to personate a
candidate for honours, and pass an examination for him.&nbsp; A
pleasing example of this kind, illustrating the limitations of
ghosts, is told in Mr. Giles&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; A gentleman of
Huai Shang named Chou-t&lsquo;ien-i had arrived at the age of
fifty, but his family consisted of but one son, a fine boy,
&ldquo;strangely averse from study,&rdquo; as if there were
anything strange in <i>that</i>.&nbsp; One day the son
disappeared mysteriously, as people do from West Ham.&nbsp; In a
year he came back, said he had been detained in a Taoist
monastery, and, to all men&rsquo;s amazement, took to his
books.&nbsp; Next year he obtained is B.A. degree, a First
Class.&nbsp; All the neighbourhood was overjoyed, for Huai Shang
was like Pembroke College (Oxford), where, according to the poet,
&ldquo;First Class men are few and far between.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was who should have the honour of giving his daughter as bride to
this intellectual marvel.&nbsp; A very nice girl was selected,
but most unexpectedly the B.A. would not marry.&nbsp; This nearly
broke his father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; The old gentleman knew,
according to Chinese belief, that if he had no grandchild there
would be no one in the next generation to feed his own ghost and
pay it all the little needful attentions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Picture
then the father naming and insisting on the day;&rdquo; till
K&lsquo;o-ch&lsquo;ang, B.A., got up and ran away.&nbsp; His
mother tried to detain him, when his clothes &ldquo;came off in
her hand,&rdquo; and the bachelor vanished!&nbsp; Next day
appeared the real flesh and blood son, who had been kidnapped and
enslaved.&nbsp; The genuine K&lsquo;o-ch&lsquo;ang was overjoyed
to hear of his approaching nuptials.&nbsp; The rites were duly
celebrated, and in less than a year the old gentleman welcomed
his much-longed-for grand child.&nbsp; But, oddly enough,
K&lsquo;o-ch&lsquo;ang, though very jolly and universally
beloved, was as stupid as ever, and read nothing but the sporting
intelligence in the newspapers.&nbsp; It was now universally
admitted that the learned K&lsquo;o-ch&lsquo;ang had been an
impostor, a clever ghost.&nbsp; It follows that ghosts can take a
very good degree; but ladies need not be afraid of marrying
ghosts, owing to the inveterate shyness of these learned
spectres.</p>

<p>The Chinese ghost is by no means always a malevolent person,
as, indeed, has already been made clear from the affecting
narrative of the ghost who passed an examination.&nbsp; Even the
spectre which answers in China to the statue in &lsquo;Don
Juan,&rsquo; the statue which accepts invitations to dinner, is
anything but a malevolent guest.&nbsp; So much may be gathered
from the story of Chu and Lu.&nbsp; Chu was an undergraduate of
great courage and bodily vigour, but dull of wit.&nbsp; He was a
married man, and his children (as in the old Oxford legend) often
rushed into their mother&rsquo;s presence, shouting,
&ldquo;Mamma! mammal papa&rsquo;s been plucked
again!&rdquo;&nbsp; Once it chanced that Chu was at a wine party,
and the negus (a favourite beverage of the Celestials) had done
its work.&nbsp; His young friends betted Chu a bird&rsquo;s-nest
dinner that he would not go to the nearest temple, enter the room
devoted to coloured sculptures representing the torments of
Purgatory, and carry off the image of the Chinese judge of the
dead, their Osiris or Rhadamanthus.&nbsp; Off went old Chu, and
soon returned with the august effigy (which wore &ldquo;a green
face, a red beard, and a hideous expression&rdquo;) in his
arms.&nbsp; The other men were frightened, and begged Chu to
restore his worship to his place on the infernal bench.&nbsp;
Before carrying back the worthy magistrate, Chu poured a libation
on the ground and said, &ldquo;Whenever your excellency feels so
disposed, I shall be glad to take a cup of wine with you in a
friendly way.&rdquo;&nbsp; That very night, as Chu was taking a
stirrup cup before going to bed, the ghost of the awful judge
came to the door and entered.&nbsp; Chu promptly put the kettle
on, mixed the negus, and made a night of it with the festive
fiend.&nbsp; Their friendship was never interrupted from that
moment.&nbsp; The judge even gave Chu a new heart (literally)
whereby he was enabled to pass examinations; for the heart, in
China, is the seat of all the intellectual faculties.&nbsp; For
Mrs. Chu, a plain woman with a fine figure, the ghost provided a
new head, of a handsome girl recently slain by a robber.&nbsp;
Even after Chu&rsquo;s death the genial spectre did not neglect
him, but obtained for him an appointment as registrar in the next
world, with a certain rank attached.</p>
<p>The next world, among the Chinese, seems to be a paradise of
bureaucracy, patent places, jobs, mandarins&rsquo; buttons and
tails, and, in short, the heaven of officialism.&nbsp; All
civilised readers are acquainted with Mr. Stockton&rsquo;s
humorous story of &lsquo;The Transferred Ghost.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Mr. Stockton&rsquo;s view a man does not always get his own
ghostship; there is a vigorous competition among spirits for good
ghostships, and a great deal of intrigue and party feeling.&nbsp;
It may be long before a disembodied spectre gets any ghostship at
all, and then, if he has little influence, he may be glad to take
a chance of haunting the Board of Trade, or the Post Office,
instead of &ldquo;walking&rdquo; in the Foreign Office.&nbsp; One
spirit may win a post as White Lady in the imperial palace, while
another is put off with a position in an old college library, or
perhaps has to follow the fortunes of some seedy
&ldquo;medium&rdquo; through boarding-houses and third-rate
hotels.&nbsp; Now this is precisely the Chinese view of the fates
and fortunes of ghosts.&nbsp; <i>Quisque suos patimur
manes</i>.</p>
<p>In China, to be brief, and to quote a ghost (who ought to know
what he was speaking about), &ldquo;supernaturals are to be found
everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the fact that makes life so
puzzling and terrible to a child of a believing and trustful
character.&nbsp; These Oriental bogies do not appear in the dark
alone, or only in haunted houses, or at cross-roads, or in gloomy
woods.&nbsp; They are everywhere: every man has his own ghost,
every place has its peculiar haunting fiend, every natural
phenomenon has its informing spirit; every quality, as hunger,
greed, envy, malice, has an embodied visible shape prowling about
seeking what it may devour.&nbsp; Where our science, for example,
sees (or rather smells) sewer gas, the Japanese behold a slimy,
meagre, insatiate wraith, crawling to devour the lives of
men.&nbsp; Where we see a storm of snow, their livelier fancy
beholds a comic snow-ghost, a queer, grinning old man under a
vast umbrella.</p>

<p>The illustrations in this paper are only a few specimens
chosen out of many volumes of Japanese bogies.&nbsp; We have not
ventured to copy the very most awful spectres, nor dared to be as
horrid as we can.&nbsp; These native drawings, too, are generally
coloured regardless of expense, and the colouring is often
horribly lurid and satisfactory.&nbsp; This embellishment,
fortunately perhaps, we cannot reproduce.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if any
child looks into this essay, let him (or her) not be alarmed by
the pictures he beholds.&nbsp; Japanese ghosts do not live in
this country; there are none of them even at the Japanese
Legation.&nbsp; Just as bears, lions, and rattlesnakes are not to
be seriously dreaded in our woods and commons, so the Japanese
ghost cannot breathe (any more than a slave can) in the air of
England or America.&nbsp; We do not yet even keep any ghostly
zoological garden in which the bogies of Japanese, Australians,
Red Indians, and other distant peoples may be accommodated.&nbsp;
Such an establishment is perhaps to be desired in the interests
of psychical research, but that form of research has not yet been
endowed by a cultivated and progressive government.</p>
<p>The first to attract our attention represents, as I
understand, the common ghost, or <i>simulacrum vulgare</i> of
psychical science.&nbsp; To this complexion must we all come,
according to the best Japanese opinion.&nbsp; Each of us contains
within him &ldquo;somewhat of a shadowy being,&rdquo; like the
spectre described by Dr. Johnson: something like the Egyptian
&ldquo;Ka,&rdquo; for which the curious may consult the works of
Miss Amelia B. Edwards and other learned Orientalists.&nbsp; The
most recent French student of these matters, the author of
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Homme Posthume,&rsquo; is of opinion that we do
not all possess this double, with its power of surviving our
bodily death.&nbsp; He thinks, too, that our ghost, when it does
survive, has but rarely the energy and enterprise to make itself
visible to or audible by &ldquo;shadow-casting men.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In some extreme cases the ghost (according to our French
authority, that of a disciple of M. Comte) feeds fearsomely on
the bodies of the living.&nbsp; In no event does he believe that
a ghost lasts much longer than a hundred years.&nbsp; After that
it mizzles into spectre, and is resolved into its elements,
whatever they may be.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar and (to my own mind) probably sound theory
of ghosts prevails among savage tribes, and among such peoples as
the ancient Greeks, the modern Hindoos, and other ancestor
worshippers.&nbsp; When feeding, as they all do, or used to do,
the ghosts of the ancestral dead, they gave special attention to
the claims of the dead of the last three generations, leaving
ghosts older than the century to look after their own supplies of
meat and drink.&nbsp; The negligence testifies to a notion that
very old ghosts are of little account, for good or evil.&nbsp; On
the other hand, as regards the longevity of spectres, we must not
shut our eyes to the example of the bogie in ancient armour which
appears in Glamis Castle, or to the Jesuit of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s date that haunts the library (and a very nice
place to haunt: I ask no better, as a ghost in the Pavilion at
Lord&rsquo;s might cause a scandal) of an English nobleman.&nbsp;
With these <i>instanti&aelig; contradictori&aelig;</i>, as Bacon
calls them, present to our minds, we must not (in the present
condition of psychical research) dogmatise too hastily about the
span of life allotted to the <i>simulacrum vulgare</i>.&nbsp;
Very probably his chances of a prolonged existence are in inverse
ratio to the square of the distance of time which severs him from
our modern days.&nbsp; No one has ever even pretended to see the
ghost of an ancient Roman buried in these islands, still less of
a Pict or Scot, or a Pal&aelig;olithic man, welcome as such an
apparition would be to many of us.&nbsp; Thus the evidence does
certainly look as if there were a kind of statute of limitations
among ghosts, which, from many points of view, is not an
arrangement at which we should repine.</p>

<p>The Japanese artist expresses his own sense of the casual and
fluctuating nature of ghosts by drawing his spectre in shaky
lines, as if the model had given the artist the horrors.&nbsp;
This <i>simulacrum</i> rises out of the earth like an exhalation,
and groups itself into shape above the spade with which all that
is corporeal of its late owner has been interred.&nbsp; Please
remark the uncomforted and dismal expression of the
<i>simulacrum</i>.&nbsp; We must remember that the ghost or
&ldquo;Ka&rdquo; is not the &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; which has other
destinies in the future world, good or evil, but is only a
shadowy resemblance, condemned, as in the Egyptian creed, to
dwell in the tomb and hover near it.&nbsp; The Chinese and
Japanese have their own definite theory of the next world, and we
must by no means confuse the eternal fortunes of the permanent,
conscious, and responsible self, already inhabiting other worlds
than ours, with the eccentric vagaries of the semi-material
tomb-haunting larva, which so often develops a noisy and
bear-fighting disposition quite unlike the character of its
proprietor in life.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The next bogie, so limp and washed-out as he seems, with his
white, drooping, dripping arms and hands, reminds us of that
horrid French species of apparition, &ldquo;la lavandi&egrave;re
de la nuit,&rdquo; who washes dead men&rsquo;s linen in the
moonlit pools and rivers.&nbsp; Whether this <i>simulacrum</i> be
meant for the spirit of the well (for everything has its spirit
in Japan), or whether it be the ghost of some mortal drowned in
the well, I cannot say with absolute certainty; but the opinion
of the learned tends to the former conclusion.&nbsp; Naturally a
Japanese child, when sent in the dusk to draw water, will do so
with fear and trembling, for this limp, floppy apparition might
scare the boldest.&nbsp; Another bogie, a terrible creation of
fancy, I take to be a vampire, about which the curious can read
in Dom Calmet, who will tell them how whole villages in Hungary
have been depopulated by vampires; or he may study in
Fauriel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chansons de la Gr&egrave;ce Moderne&rsquo;
the vampires of modern Hellas.</p>
<p>Another plan, and perhaps even more satisfactory to a timid or
superstitious mind, is to read in a lonely house at midnight a
story named &lsquo;Carmilla,&rsquo; printed in Mr. Sheridan Le
Fanu&rsquo;s &lsquo;In a Glass Darkly.&rsquo;&nbsp; That work
will give you the peculiar sentiment of vampirism, will produce a
gelid perspiration, and reduce the patient to a condition in
which he will be afraid to look round the room.&nbsp; If, while
in this mood, some one tells him Mr. Augustus Hare&rsquo;s story
of Crooglin Grange, his education in the practice and theory of
vampires will be complete, and he will be a very proper and
well-qualified inmate of Earlswood Asylum.&nbsp; The most awful
Japanese vampire, caught red-handed in the act, a hideous,
bestial incarnation of ghoulishness, we have carefully refrained
from reproducing.</p>

<p>Scarcely more agreeable is the bogie, or witch, blowing from
her mouth a malevolent exhalation, an embodiment of malignant and
maleficent sorcery.&nbsp; The vapour which flies and curls from
the mouth constitutes &ldquo;a sending,&rdquo; in the technical
language of Icelandic wizards, and is capable (in Iceland, at all
events) of assuming the form of some detestable supernatural
animal, to destroy the life of a hated rival.&nbsp; In the case
of our last example it is very hard indeed to make head or tail
of the spectre represented.&nbsp; Chinks and crannies are his
domain; through these he drops upon you.&nbsp; He is a merry but
not an attractive or genial ghost.&nbsp; Where there are such
&ldquo;visions about&rdquo; it may be admitted that children, apt
to believe in all such fancies, have a youth of variegated and
intense misery, recurring with special vigour at bed-time.&nbsp;
But we look again at our first picture, and hope and trust that
Japanese boys and girls are as happy as these jolly little
creatures appear.</p>

69</span><i>LITERARY FORGERIES</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the whole amusing history of
impostures, there is no more diverting chapter than that which
deals with literary frauds.&nbsp; None contains a more grotesque
revelation of the smallness and the complexity of human nature,
and none&mdash;not even the records of the Tichborne trial, nor
of general elections&mdash;displays more pleasantly the depths of
mortal credulity.&nbsp; The literary forger is usually a clever
man, and it is necessary for him to be at least on a level with
the literary knowledge and critical science of his time.&nbsp;
But how low that level commonly appears to be!&nbsp; Think of the
success of Ireland, a boy of eighteen; think of Chatterton; think
of Surtees of Mainsforth, who took in the great Sir Walter
himself, the father of all them that are skilled in ballad
lore.&nbsp; How simple were the artifices of these ingenious
impostors, their resources how scanty; how hand-to-mouth and
improvised was their whole procedure!&nbsp; Times have altered a
little.&nbsp; Jo Smith&rsquo;s revelation and famed &lsquo;Golden
Bible&rsquo; only carried captive the polygamous <i>populus qui
vult decipi</i>, reasoners a little lower than even the believers
in Anglo-Israel.&nbsp; The Moabite Ireland, who once gave Mr.
Shapira the famous MS. of Deuteronomy, but did not delude M.
Clermont-Ganneau, was doubtless a smart man; he was, however, a
little too indolent, a little too easily satisfied.&nbsp; He
might have procured better and less recognisable materials than
his old &ldquo;synagogue rolls;&rdquo; in short, he took rather
too little trouble, and came to the wrong market.&nbsp; A
literary forgery ought first, perhaps, to appeal to the
credulous, and only slowly should it come, with the prestige of
having already won many believers, before the learned
world.&nbsp; The inscriber of the Phoenician inscriptions in
Brazil (of all places) was a clever man.&nbsp; His account of the
voyage of Hiram to South America probably gained some credence in
Brazil, while in England it only carried captive Mr. Day, author
of &lsquo;The Prehistoric Use of Iron and Steel.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
the Brazilians, from lack of energy, have dropped the subject,
and the Phoenician inscriptions of Brazil are less successful,
after all, than the Moabite stone, about which one begins to
entertain disagreeable doubts.</p>
<p>The motives of the literary forger are curiously mixed; but
they may, perhaps, be analysed roughly into piety, greed,
&ldquo;push,&rdquo; and love of fun.&nbsp; Many literary
forgeries have been pious frauds, perpetrated in the interests of
a church, a priesthood, or a dogma.&nbsp; Then we have frauds of
greed, as if, for example, a forger should offer his wares for a
million of money to the British Museum; or when he tries to palm
off his Samaritan Gospel on the &ldquo;Bad Samaritan&rdquo; of
the Bodleian.&nbsp; Next we come to playful frauds, or frauds in
their origin playful, like (perhaps) the Shakespearian forgeries
of Ireland, the <i>supercheries</i> of Prosper
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, the sham antique ballads (very spirited
poems in their way) of Surtees, and many other examples.&nbsp;
Occasionally it has happened that forgeries, begun for the mere
sake of exerting the imitative faculty, and of raising a laugh
against the learned, have been persevered with in earnest.&nbsp;
The humorous deceits are, of course, the most pardonable, though
it is difficult to forgive the young arch&aelig;ologist who took
in his own father with false Greek inscriptions.&nbsp; But this
story may be a mere fable amongst arch&aelig;ologists, who are
constantly accusing each other of all manner of crimes.&nbsp;
Then there are forgeries by &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; men, who hope
to get a reading for poems which, if put forth as new, would be
neglected.&nbsp; There remain forgeries of which the motives are
so complex as to remain for ever obscure.&nbsp; We may generally
ascribe them to love of notoriety in the forger; such notoriety
as Macpherson won by his dubious pinchbeck Ossian.&nbsp; More
difficult still to understand are the forgeries which real
scholars have committed or connived at for the purpose of
supporting some opinion which they held with earnestness.&nbsp;
There is a vein of madness and self-deceit in the character of
the man who half-persuades himself that his own false facts are
true.&nbsp; The Payne Collier case is thus one of the most
difficult in the world to explain, for it is equally hard to
suppose that Mr. Payne Collier was taken in by the notes on the
folio he gave the world, and to hold that he was himself guilty
of forgery to support his own opinions.</p>
<p>The further we go back in the history of literary forgeries,
the more (as is natural) do we find them to be of a pious or
priestly character.&nbsp; When the clergy alone can write, only
the clergy can forge.&nbsp; In such ages people are interested
chiefly in prophecies and warnings, or, if they are careful about
literature, it is only when literature contains some kind of
title-deeds.&nbsp; Thus Solon is said to have forged a line in
the Homeric catalogue of the ships for the purpose of proving
that Salamis belonged to Athens.&nbsp; But the great antique
forger, the &ldquo;Ionian father of the rest,&rdquo; is,
doubtless, Onomacritus.&nbsp; There exists, to be sure, an
Egyptian inscription professing to be of the fourth, but probably
of the twenty-sixth, dynasty.&nbsp; The Germans hold the latter
view; the French, from patriotic motives, maintain the opposite
opinion.&nbsp; But this forgery is scarcely
&ldquo;literary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never can think of Onomacritus without a certain respect: he
began the forging business so very early, and was (apart from
this failing) such an imposing and magnificently respectable
character.&nbsp; The scene of the error and the detection of
Onomacritus presents itself always to me in a kind of pictorial
vision.&nbsp; It is night, the clear, windless night of Athens;
not of the Athens whose ruins remain, but of the ancient city
that sank in ashes during the invasion of Xerxes.&nbsp; The time
is the time of Pisistratus the successful tyrant; the scene is
the ancient temple, the stately house of Athen&ecirc;, the fane
where the sacred serpent was fed on cakes, and the primeval
olive-tree grew beside the well of Posidon.&nbsp; The darkness of
the temple&rsquo;s inmost shrine is lit by the ray of one earthen
lamp.&nbsp; You dimly discern the majestic form of a venerable
man stooping above a coffer of cedar and ivory, carved with the
exploits of the goddess, and with <i>boustrophedon</i>
inscriptions.&nbsp; In his hair this archaic Athenian wears the
badge of the golden grasshopper.&nbsp; He is Onomacritus, the
famous poet, and the trusted guardian of the ancient oracles of
Musaeus and Bacis.</p>
<p>What is he doing?&nbsp; Why, he takes from the fragrant cedar
coffer certain thin stained sheets of lead, whereon are scratched
the words of doom, the prophecies of the Greek Thomas the
Rhymer.&nbsp; From his bosom he draws another thin sheet of lead,
also stained and corroded.&nbsp; On this he scratches, in
imitation of the old &ldquo;Cadmeian letters,&rdquo; a prophecy
that &ldquo;the Isles near Lemnos shall disappear under the
sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; So busy is he in this task, that he does not
hear the rustle of a chiton behind, and suddenly a man&rsquo;s
hand is on his shoulder!&nbsp; Onomacritus turns in horror.&nbsp;
Has the goddess punished him for tampering with the
oracles?&nbsp; No; it is Lasus, the son of Hermiones, a rival
poet, who has caught the keeper of the oracles in the very act of
a pious forgery.&nbsp; (Herodotus, vii. 6.)</p>
<p>Pisistratus expelled the learned Onomacritus from Athens, but
his conduct proved, in the long run, highly profitable to the
reputations of Musaeus and Bacis.&nbsp; Whenever one of their
oracles was not fulfilled, people said, &ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> is
merely one of the interpolations of Onomacritus!&rdquo; and the
matter was passed over.&nbsp; This Onomacritus is said to have
been among the original editors of Homer under Pisistratus. <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a>&nbsp; He lived long, never repented,
and, many years later, deceived Xerxes into attempting his
disastrous expedition.&nbsp; This he did by &ldquo;keeping back
the oracles unfavourable to the barbarians,&rdquo; and putting
forward any that seemed favourable.&nbsp; The children of
Pisistratus believed in him as spiritualists go on giving credit
to exposed and exploded &ldquo;mediums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having once practised deceit, it is to be feared that
Onomacritus acquired a liking for the art of literary forgery,
which, as will be seen in the case of Ireland, grows on a man
like dram-drinking.&nbsp; Onomacritus is generally charged with
the authorship of the poems which the ancients usually attributed
to Orpheus, the companion of Jason.&nbsp; Perhaps the most
interesting of the poems of Orpheus to us would have been his
&lsquo;Inferno,&rsquo; or,
&Kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8049;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;
&#8050;&sigmaf; &#8068;&delta;&omicron;&upsilon;, in which the
poet gave his own account of his descent to Hades in search of
Eurydice.&nbsp; But only a dubious reference to one adventure in
the journey is quoted by Plutarch.&nbsp; Whatever the exact truth
about the Orphic poems may be (the reader may pursue the hard and
fruitless quest in Lobeck&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aglaophamus&rsquo; <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a>), it seems certain that the period
between Pisistratus and Pericles, like the Alexandrian time, was
a great age for literary forgeries.&nbsp; But of all these frauds
the greatest (according to the most &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; theory
on the subject) is the &ldquo;Forgery of the Iliad and
Odyssey!&rdquo;&nbsp; The opinions of the scholars who hold that
the Iliad and Odyssey, which we know and which Plato knew, are
not the epics known to Herodotus, but later compositions, are not
very clear nor consistent.&nbsp; But it seems to be vaguely held
that about the time of Pericles there arose a kind of Greek
Macpherson.&nbsp; This ingenious impostor worked on old epic
materials, but added many new ideas of his own about the gods,
converting the Iliad (the poem which we now possess) into a kind
of mocking romance, a Greek Don Quixote.&nbsp; He also forged a
number of pseudo-archaic words, tenses, and expressions, and
added the numerous references to iron, a metal practically
unknown, it is asserted, to Greece before the sixth
century.&nbsp; If we are to believe, with Professor Paley, that
the chief incidents of the Iliad and Odyssey were unknown to
Sophocles, &AElig;schylus, and the contemporary vase painters, we
must also suppose that the Greek Macpherson invented most of the
situations in the Odyssey and Iliad.&nbsp; According to this
theory the &lsquo;cooker&rsquo; of the extant epics was far the
greatest and most successful of all literary impostors, for he
deceived the whole world, from Plato downwards, till he was
exposed by Mr. Paley.&nbsp; There are times when one is inclined
to believe that Plato must have been the forger himself, as Bacon
(according to the other hypothesis) was the author of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; Thus &ldquo;Plato the wise, and
large-browed Verulam,&rdquo; would be &ldquo;the first of those
who&rdquo; forge!&nbsp; Next to this prodigious imposture, no
doubt, the false &lsquo;Letters of Phalaris&rsquo; are the most
important of classical forgeries.&nbsp; And these illustrate,
like most literary forgeries, the extreme worthlessness of
literary taste as a criterion of the authenticity of
writings.&nbsp; For what man ever was more a man of taste than
Sir William Temple, &ldquo;the most accomplished writer of the
age,&rdquo; whom Mr. Boyle never thought of without calling to
mind those happy lines of Lucretius,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quem
tu, dea, tempore in omni<br />
Omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the ornate and excellent Temple held that &ldquo;the
Epistles of Phalaris have more race, more spirit, more force of
wit and genius, than any others he had ever seen, either ancient
or modern.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for what Bentley calls
Temple&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nicety of Tast.&rdquo;&nbsp; The greatest
of English scholars readily proved that Phalaris used (in the
spirit of prophecy) an idiom which did not exist to write about
matters in his time not invented, but &ldquo;many centuries
younger than he.&rdquo;&nbsp; So let the Nicety of Temple&rsquo;s
Tast and its absolute failure be a warning to us when we read (if
read we must) German critics who deny Homer&rsquo;s claim to this
or that passage, and Plato&rsquo;s right to half his accepted
dialogues, on grounds of literary taste.&nbsp; And farewell, as
Herodotus would have said, to the Letters of Phalaris, of
Socrates, of Plato; to the Lives of Pythagoras and of Homer, and
to all the other uncounted literary forgeries of the classical
world, from the Sibylline prophecies to the battle of the frogs
and mice.</p>
<p>Early Christian frauds were, naturally, pious.&nbsp; We have
the apocryphal Gospels, and the works of Dionysius the
Areopagite, which were not exposed till Erasmus&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Perhaps the most important of pious forgeries (if
forgery be exactly the right word in this case) was that of
&lsquo;The False Decretals.&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a
sudden,&rdquo; says Milman, speaking of the pontificate of
Nicholas I. (<i>ob.</i> 867 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>),
&ldquo;Of a sudden was promulgated, unannounced, without
preparation, not absolutely unquestioned, but apparently
over-awing at once all doubt, a new Code, which to the former
authentic documents added fifty-nine letters and decrees of the
twenty oldest Popes from Clement to Melchiades, and the donation
of Constantine, and in the third part, among the decrees of the
Popes and of the Councils from Sylvester to Gregory II.,
thirty-nine false decrees, and the acts of several unauthentic
Councils.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The whole is composed,&rdquo;
Milman adds, &ldquo;with an air of profound piety and
reverence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The False Decretals naturally assert the
supremacy of the Bishop of Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are full and
minute on Church Property&rdquo; (they were sure to be that); in
fact, they remind one of another forgery, pious and Aryan,
&lsquo;The Institutes of Vishnu.&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him not
levy any tax upon Brahmans,&rdquo; says the Brahman forger of the
Institutes, which &ldquo;came from the mouths of Vishnu,&rdquo;
as he sat &ldquo;clad in a yellow robe, imperturbable, decorated
with all kinds of gems, while Lakshmi was stroking his feet with
her soft palms.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Institutes took excellent care
of Brahmans and cows, as the Decretals did of the Pope and the
clergy, and the earliest Popes had about as much hand in the
Decretals as Vishnu had in his Institutes.&nbsp; Hommenay, in
&lsquo;Pantagruel,&rsquo; did well to have the praise of the
Decretals sung by <i>filles belles</i>, <i>blondelettes</i>,
<i>doulcettes</i>, <i>et de bonne grace</i>.&nbsp; And then
Hommenay drank to the Decretals and their very good health.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O dives D&eacute;cretales, tant par vous est le vin bon
bon trouv&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O divine Decretals, how
good you make good wine taste!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The miracle
would be greater,&rdquo; said Pantagruel, &ldquo;if they made bad
wine taste good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most that can now be done by
the devout for the Decretals is &ldquo;to palliate the guilt of
their forger,&rdquo; whose name, like that of the Greek
Macpherson, is unknown.</p>
<p>If the early Christian centuries, and the Middle Ages, were
chiefly occupied with pious frauds, with forgeries of gospels,
epistles, and Decretals, the impostors of the Renaissance were
busy, as an Oxford scholar said, when he heard of a new MS. of
the Greek Testament, &ldquo;with something really
important,&rdquo; that is with classical imitations.&nbsp; After
the Turks took Constantinople, when the learned Greeks were
scattered all over Southern Europe, when many genuine classical
manuscripts were recovered by the zeal of scholars, when the
plays of Menander were seen once, and then lost for ever, it was
natural that literary forgery should thrive.&nbsp; As yet
scholars were eager rather than critical; they were collecting
and unearthing, rather than minutely examining the remains of
classic literature.&nbsp; They had found so much, and every year
were finding so much more, that no discovery seemed
impossible.&nbsp; The lost books of Livy and Cicero, the songs of
Sappho, the perished plays of Sophocles and &AElig;schylus might
any day be brought to light.&nbsp; This was the very moment for
the literary forger; but it is improbable that any forgery of the
period has escaped detection.&nbsp; Three or four years ago some
one published a book to show that the &lsquo;Annals of
Tacitus&rsquo; were written by Poggio Bracciolini.&nbsp; This
paradox gained no more converts than the bolder hypothesis of
Hardouin.&nbsp; The theory of Hardouin was all that the ancient
classics were productions of a learned company which worked, in
the thirteenth century, under Severus Archontius.&nbsp; Hardouin
made some exceptions to his sweeping general theory.&nbsp;
Cicero&rsquo;s writings were genuine, he admitted, so were
Pliny&rsquo;s, of Virgil the Georgics; the satires and epistles
of Horace; Herodotus, and Homer.&nbsp; All the rest of the
classics were a magnificent forgery of the illiterate thirteenth
century, which had scarce any Greek, and whose Latin, abundant in
quantity, in quality left much to be desired.</p>
<p>Among literary forgers, or passers of false literary coin, at
the time of the Renaissance, Annius is the most notorious.&nbsp;
Annius (his real vernacular name was Nanni) was born at Viterbo,
in 1432.&nbsp; He became a Dominican, and (after publishing his
forged classics) rose to the position of Ma&icirc;tre du Palais
to the Pope, Alexander Borgia.&nbsp; With C&aelig;sar Borgia it
is said that Annius was never on good terms.&nbsp; He persisted
in preaching &ldquo;the sacred truth&rdquo; to his highness and
this (according to the detractors of Annius) was the only use he
made of the sacred truth.&nbsp; There is a legend that
C&aelig;sar Borgia poisoned the preacher (1502), but people
usually brought that charge against C&aelig;sar when any one in
any way connected with him happened to die.&nbsp; Annius wrote on
the History and Empire of the Turks, who took Constantinople in
his time; but he is better remembered by his &lsquo;Antiquitatum
Variarum Volumina XVII. cum comment.&nbsp; Fr. Jo.
Annii.&rsquo;&nbsp; These fragments of antiquity included, among
many other desirable things, the historical writings of Fabius
Pictor, the predecessor of Livy.&nbsp; One is surprised that
Annius, when he had his hand in, did not publish choice extracts
from the &lsquo;Libri Lintei,&rsquo; the ancient Roman annals,
written on linen and preserved in the temple of Juno
Moneta.&nbsp; Among the other discoveries of Annius were
treatises by Berosus, Manetho, Cato, and poems by
Archilochus.&nbsp; Opinion has been divided as to whether Annius
was wholly a knave, or whether he was himself imposed upon.&nbsp;
Or, again, whether he had some genuine fragments, and eked them
out with his own inventions.&nbsp; It is observed that he did not
dovetail the really genuine relics of Berosus and Manetho into
the works attributed to them.&nbsp; This may be explained as the
result of ignorance or of cunning; there can be no certain
inference.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even the Dominicans,&rdquo; as Bayle
says, admit that Annius&rsquo;s discoveries are false, though
they excuse them by averring that the pious man was the dupe of
others.&nbsp; But a learned Lutheran has been found to defend the
&lsquo;Antiquitates&rsquo; of the Dominican.</p>
<p>It is amusing to remember that the great and erudite Rabelais
was taken in by some pseudo-classical fragments.&nbsp; The joker
of jokes was hoaxed.&nbsp; He published, says Mr. Besant,
&ldquo;a couple of Latin forgeries, which he proudly called
&lsquo;Ex reliquiis venerand&aelig; antiquitatis,&rsquo;
consisting of a pretended will and a contract.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
name of the book is &lsquo;Ex reliquiis venerand&aelig;
antiquitatis.&nbsp; Lucii Cuspidii Testamentum.&nbsp; Item
contractus venditionis antiquis Romanorum temporibus
initus.&nbsp; <i>Lugduni apud Gryphium</i> (1532).&rsquo;&nbsp;
Pomponius L&aelig;tus and Jovianus Pontanus were apparently
authors of the hoax.</p>
<p>Socrates said that he &ldquo;would never lift up his hand
against his father Parmenides.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fathers of the
Church have not been so respectfully treated by literary forgers
during the Renaissance.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Flowers of
Theology&rsquo; of St. Bernard, which were to be a primrose path
<i>ad gaudia Paradisi</i> (Strasburg, 1478), were really, it
seems, the production of Jean de Garlande.&nbsp; Athanasius, his
&lsquo;Eleven Books concerning the Trinity,&rsquo; are attributed
to Vigilius, a colonial Bishop in Northern Africa.&nbsp; Among
false classics were two comic Latin fragments with which Muretus
beguiled Scaliger.&nbsp; Meursius has suffered, posthumously,
from the attribution to him of a very disreputable volume
indeed.&nbsp; In 1583, a book on &lsquo;Consolations,&rsquo; by
Cicero, was published at Venice, containing the reflections with
which Cicero consoled himself for the death of Tullia.&nbsp; It
might as well have been attributed to Mrs. Blimber, and described
as replete with the thoughts by which that lady supported herself
under the affliction of never having seen Cicero or his Tusculan
villa.&nbsp; The real author was Charles Sigonius, of
Modena.&nbsp; Sigonius actually did discover some Ciceronian
fragments, and, if he was not the builder, at least he was the
restorer of Tully&rsquo;s lofty theme.&nbsp; In 1693,
Fran&ccedil;ois Nodot, conceiving the world had not already
enough of Petronius Arbiter, published an edition, in which he
added to the works of that lax though accomplished author.&nbsp;
Nodot&rsquo;s story was that he had found a whole MS. of
Petronius at Belgrade, and he published it with a translation of
his own Latin into French.&nbsp; Still dissatisfied with the
existing supply of Petronius&rsquo; humour was Marchena, a writer
of Spanish books, who printed at B&acirc;le a translation and
edition of a new fragment.&nbsp; This fragment was very cleverly
inserted in a presumed <i>lacuna</i>.&nbsp; In spite of the
ironical style of the preface many scholars were taken in by this
fragment, and their credulity led Marchena to find a new morsel
(of Catullus this time) at Herculaneum.&nbsp; Eichstadt, a Jena
professor, gravely announced that the same fragment existed in a
MS. in the university library, and, under pretence of giving
various readings, corrected Marchena&rsquo;s faults in
prosody.&nbsp; Another sham Catullus, by Corradino, a Venetian,
was published in 1738.</p>
<p>The most famous forgeries of the eighteenth century were those
of Macpherson, Chatterton, and Ireland.&nbsp; Space (fortunately)
does not permit a discussion of the Ossianic question.&nbsp; That
fragments of Ossianic legend (if not of Ossianic poetry) survive
in oral Gaelic traditions, seems certain.&nbsp; How much
Macpherson knew of these, and how little he used them in the
bombastic prose which Napoleon loved (and spelled
&ldquo;Ocean&rdquo;), it is next to impossible to discover.&nbsp;
The case of Chatterton is too well known to need much more than
mention.&nbsp; The most extraordinary poet for his years who ever
lived began with the forgery of a sham feudal pedigree for Mr.
Bergum, a pewterer.&nbsp; Ireland started on his career in much
the same way, unless Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Confessions&rsquo; be
themselves a fraud, based on what he knew about Chatterton.&nbsp;
Once launched in his career, Chatterton drew endless stores of
poetry from &ldquo;Rowley&rsquo;s MS.&rdquo; and the muniment
chest in St. Mary Redcliffe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Jacob Bryant believed
in them and wrote an &lsquo;Apology&rsquo; for the
credulous.&nbsp; Bryant, who believed in his own system of
mythology, might have believed in anything.&nbsp; When Chatterton
sent his &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; to Walpole (himself somewhat
of a medi&aelig;val imitator), Gray and Mason detected the
imposture, and Walpole, his feelings as an antiquary injured took
no more notice of the boy.&nbsp; Chatterton&rsquo;s death was due
to his precocity.&nbsp; Had his genius come to him later, it
would have found him wiser, and better able to command the fatal
demon of intellect, for which he had to find work, like Michael
Scott in the legend.</p>
<p>The end of the eighteenth century, which had been puzzled or
diverted by the Chatterton and Macpherson frauds, witnessed also
the great and famous Shakespearian forgeries.&nbsp; We shall
never know the exact truth about the fabrication of the
Shakespearian documents, and &lsquo;Vortigern&rsquo; and the
other plays.&nbsp; We have, indeed, the confession of the
culprit: <i>habemus confitentem reum</i>, but Mr. W. H. Ireland
was a liar and a solicitor&rsquo;s clerk, so versatile and
accomplished that we cannot always trust him, even when he is
narrating the tale of his own iniquities.&nbsp; The temporary but
wide and turbulent success of the Ireland forgeries suggests the
disagreeable reflection that criticism and learning are (or a
hundred years ago were) worth very little as literary
touchstones.&nbsp; A polished and learned society, a society
devoted to Shakespeare and to the stage, was taken in by a boy of
eighteen.&nbsp; Young Ireland not only palmed off his sham prose
documents, most makeshift imitations of the antique, but even his
ridiculous verses on the experts.&nbsp; James Boswell went down
on his knees and thanked Heaven for the sight of them, and,
feeling thirsty after these devotions, drank hot brandy and
water.&nbsp; Dr. Parr was not less readily gulled, and probably
the experts, like Malone, who held aloof, were as much influenced
by jealousy as by science.&nbsp; The whole story of young
Ireland&rsquo;s forgeries is not only too long to be told here,
but forms the topic of a novel (&lsquo;The Talk of the
Town&rsquo;) by Mr. James Payn.&nbsp; The frauds in his hands
lose neither their humour nor their complicated interest of
plot.&nbsp; To be brief, then, Mr. Samuel Ireland was a gentleman
extremely fond of old literature and old books.&nbsp; If we may
trust the &lsquo;Confessions&rsquo; (1805) of his candid son, Mr.
W. H. Ireland, a more harmless and confiding old person than
Samuel never collected early English tracts.&nbsp; Living in his
learned society, his son, Mr. W. H. Ireland, acquired not only a
passion for black letters, but a desire to emulate
Chatterton.&nbsp; His first step in guilt was the forgery of an
autograph on an old pamphlet, with which he gratified Samuel
Ireland.&nbsp; He also wrote a sham inscription on a modern bust
of Cromwell, which he represented as an authentic antique.&nbsp;
Finding that the critics were taken in, and attributed this new
bust to the old sculptor Simeon, Ireland conceived a very low and
not unjustifiable opinion of critical tact.&nbsp; Critics would
find merit in anything which seemed old enough.&nbsp;
Ireland&rsquo;s next achievement was the forgery of some legal
documents concerning Shakespeare.&nbsp; Just as the bad man who
deceived the guileless Mr. Shapira forged his
&lsquo;Deuteronomy&rsquo; on the blank spaces of old synagogue
rolls, so young Ireland used the cut-off ends of old rent
rolls.&nbsp; He next bought up quantities of old fly-leaves of
books, and on this ancient paper he indicted a sham confession of
faith, which he attributed to Shakespeare.&nbsp; Being a strong
&ldquo;evangelical,&rdquo; young Mr. Ireland gave a very
Protestant complexion to this edifying document.&nbsp; And still
the critics gaped and wondered and believed.</p>
<p>Ireland&rsquo;s method was to write in an ink made by blending
various liquids used in the marbling of paper for
bookbinding.&nbsp; This stuff was supplied to him by a
bookbinder&rsquo;s apprentice.&nbsp; When people asked questions
as to whence all the new Shakespeare manuscripts came, he said
they were presented to him by a gentleman who wished to remain
anonymous.&nbsp; Finally, the impossibility of producing this
gentleman was one of the causes of the detection of the
fraud.&nbsp; According to himself, Ireland performed prodigies of
acuteness.&nbsp; Once he had forged, at random, the name of a
contemporary of Shakespeare.&nbsp; He was confronted with a
genuine signature, which, of course, was quite different.&nbsp;
He obtained leave to consult his &ldquo;anonymous
gentleman,&rdquo; rushed home, forged the name again on the model
of what had been shown to him, and returned with this signature
as a new gift from his benefactor.&nbsp; That nameless friend had
informed him (he swore) that there were two persons of the same
name, and that both signatures were genuine.&nbsp;
Ireland&rsquo;s impudence went the length of introducing an
ancestor of his own, with the same name as himself, among the
companions of Shakespeare.&nbsp; If &lsquo;Vortigern&rsquo; had
succeeded (and it was actually put on the stage with all possible
pomp), Ireland meant to have produced a series of
pseudo-Shakespearian plays from William the Conqueror to Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; When busy with &lsquo;Vortigern,&rsquo; he was
detected by a friend of his own age, who pounced on him while he
was at work, as Lasus pounced on Onomacritus.&nbsp; The
discoverer, however, consented to &ldquo;stand in&rdquo; with
Ireland, and did not divulge his secret.&nbsp; At last, after the
fiasco of &lsquo;Vortigern,&rsquo; suspicion waxed so strong, and
disagreeable inquiries for the anonymous benefactor were so
numerous, that Ireland fled from his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
He confessed all, and, according to his own account, fell under
the undying wrath of Samuel Ireland.&nbsp; Any reader of
Ireland&rsquo;s confessions will be likely to sympathise with old
Samuel as the dupe of his son.&nbsp; The whole story is told with
a curious mixture of impudence and humour, and with great
plausibility.&nbsp; Young Ireland admits that his &ldquo;desire
for laughter&rdquo; was almost irresistible, when
people&mdash;learned, pompous, sagacious people&mdash;listened
attentively to the papers.&nbsp; One feels half inclined to
forgive the rogue for the sake of his youth, his cleverness, his
humour.&nbsp; But the &lsquo;Confessions&rsquo; are, not
improbably, almost as apocryphal as the original documents.&nbsp;
They were written for the sake of money, and it is impossible to
say how far the same mercenary motive actuated Ireland in his
forgeries.&nbsp; Dr. Ingleby, in his &lsquo;Shakespeare
Fabrications,&rsquo; takes a very rigid view of the conduct, not
only of William, but of old Samuel Ireland.&nbsp; Sam, according
to Dr. Ingleby, was a partner in the whole imposture, and the
confession was only one element in the scheme of fraud.&nbsp; Old
Samuel was the Fagin of a band of young literary Dodgers.&nbsp;
He &ldquo;positively trained his whole family to trade in
forgery,&rdquo; and as for Mr. W. H. Ireland, he was &ldquo;the
most accomplished liar that ever lived,&rdquo; which is certainly
a distinction in its way.&nbsp; The point of the joke is that,
after the whole conspiracy exploded, people were anxious to buy
examples of the forgeries.&nbsp; Mr. W. H. Ireland was equal to
the occasion.&nbsp; He actually forged his own, or (according to
Dr. Ingleby) his father&rsquo;s forgeries, and, by thus
increasing the supply, he deluged the market with sham shams,
with imitations of imitations.&nbsp; If this accusation be
correct, it is impossible not to admire the colossal impudence of
Mr. W. H. Ireland.&nbsp; Dr. Ingleby, in the ardour of his honest
indignation, pursues William into his private life, which, it
appears, was far from exemplary.&nbsp; But literary criticism
should be content with a man&rsquo;s works; his domestic life is
matter, as Aristotle often says, &ldquo;for a separate kind of
investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Ritson used to say that
&ldquo;every literary impostor deserved hanging as much as a
common thief.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. H. Ireland&rsquo;s merits were
never recognised by the law.</p>
<p>How old Ritson would have punished &ldquo;the old
corrector,&rdquo; it is &ldquo;better only guessing,&rdquo; as
the wicked say, according to Clough, in regard to their own
possible chastisement.&nbsp; The difficulty is to ascertain who
the apocryphal old corrector really was.&nbsp; The story of his
misdeeds was recently brought back to mind by the death, at an
advanced age, of the learned Shakespearian, Mr. J. Payne
Collier.&nbsp; Mr. Collier was, to put it mildly, the Shapira of
the old corrector.&nbsp; He brought that artist&rsquo;s works
before the public; but <i>why</i>? how deceived, or how
influenced, it is once more &ldquo;better only
guessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Collier first introduced to the public
notice his singular copy of a folio Shakespeare (second edition),
loaded with ancient manuscript emendations, in 1849.&nbsp; His
account of this book was simple and plausible.&nbsp; He chanced,
one day, to be in the shop of Mr. Rudd, the bookseller, in Great
Newport Street, when a parcel of second-hand volumes arrived from
the country.&nbsp; When the parcel was opened, the heart of the
Bibliophile began to sing, for the packet contained two old
folios, one of them an old folio Shakespeare of the second
edition (1632).&nbsp; The volume (mark this) was &ldquo;much
cropped,&rdquo; greasy, and imperfect.&nbsp; Now the student of
Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; into the whole affair
is already puzzled.&nbsp; In later days, Mr. Collier said that
his folio had previously been in the possession of a Mr.
Parry.&nbsp; On the other hand, Mr. Parry (then a very aged man)
failed to recognise his folio in Mr. Collier&rsquo;s, for
<i>his</i> copy was &ldquo;cropped,&rdquo; whereas the leaves of
Mr. Collier&rsquo;s example were <i>not</i> mutilated.&nbsp;
Here, then (&lsquo;Inquiry,&rsquo; pp. 12, 61), we have two
descriptions of the outward aspect of Mr. Collier&rsquo;s dubious
treasure.&nbsp; In one account it is &ldquo;much cropped&rdquo;
by the book-binder&rsquo;s cruel shears; in the other, its
unmutilated condition is contrasted with that of a copy which has
been &ldquo;cropped.&rdquo;&nbsp; In any case, Mr. Collier hoped,
he says, to complete an imperfect folio he possessed, with leaves
taken from the folio newly acquired for thirty shillings.&nbsp;
But the volumes happened to have the same defects, and the
healing process was impossible.&nbsp; Mr. Collier chanced to be
going into the country, when in packing the folio he had bought
of Rudd he saw it was covered with manuscript corrections in an
old hand.&nbsp; These he was inclined to attribute to one Thomas
Perkins, whose name was written on the fly-leaf, and who might
have been a connection of Richard Perkins, the actor
(<i>flor.</i> 1633)&nbsp; The notes contained many various
readings, and very numerous changes in punctuation.&nbsp; Some of
these Mr. Collier published in his &lsquo;Notes and
Emendations&rsquo; (1852), and in an edition of the
&lsquo;Plays.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was much discussion, much doubt,
and the folio of the old corrector (who was presumed to have
marked the book in the theatre during early performances) was
exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries.&nbsp; Then Mr. Collier
presented the treasure to the Duke of Devonshire, who again lent
it for examination to the British Museum.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton
published in the <i>Times</i> (July, 1859) the results of his
examination of the old corrector.&nbsp; It turned out that the
old corrector was a modern myth.&nbsp; He had first made his
corrections in pencil and in a modern hand, and then he had
copied them over in ink, and in a forged ancient hand.&nbsp; The
same word sometimes recurred in both handwritings.&nbsp; The ink,
which looked old, was really no English ink at all, not even
Ireland&rsquo;s mixture.&nbsp; It seemed to be sepia, sometimes
mixed with a little Indian ink.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton made many
other sad discoveries.&nbsp; He pointed out that Mr. Collier had
published, from a Dulwich MS., a letter of Mrs. Alleyne&rsquo;s
(the actor&rsquo;s wife), referring to Shakespeare as &ldquo;Mr.
Shakespeare of the Globe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the Dulwich MS. was
mutilated and blank in the very place where this interesting
reference should have occurred.&nbsp; Such is a skeleton history
of the old corrector, his works and ways.&nbsp; It is probable
that&mdash;thanks to his assiduities&mdash;new Shakespearian
documents will in future be received with extreme scepticism; and
this is all the fruit, except acres of newspaper correspondence,
which the world has derived from Mr. Collier&rsquo;s greasy and
imperfect but unique &ldquo;corrected folio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recency and (to a Shakespearian critic) the importance of
these forgeries obscures the humble merit of Surtees, with his
ballads of the &lsquo;Slaying of Antony Featherstonhaugh,&rsquo;
and of &lsquo;Bartram&rsquo;s Dirge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surtees left
clever <i>lacun&aelig;</i> in these songs, &lsquo;collected from
oral tradition,&rsquo; and furnished notes so learned that they
took in Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; There are moments when I half
suspect &ldquo;the Shirra himsel&rdquo; (who blamelessly forged
so many extracts from &lsquo;Old Plays&rsquo;) of having composed
&lsquo;Kinmont Willie.&rsquo;&nbsp; To compare old Scott of
Satchell&rsquo;s account of Kinmont Willie with the ballad is to
feel uncomfortable doubts.&nbsp; But this is a rank
impiety.&nbsp; The last ballad forgery of much note was the set
of sham Macedonian epics and popular songs (all about Alexander
the Great, and other heroes) which a schoolmaster in the Rhodope
imposed on M. Verkovitch.&nbsp; The trick was not badly done, and
the imitation of &ldquo;ballad slang&rdquo; was excellent.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Oera Linda&rsquo; book, too, was successful enough to
be translated into English.&nbsp; With this latest effort of the
tenth muse, the crafty muse of Literary Forgery, we may leave a
topic which could not be exhausted in a ponderous volume.&nbsp;
We have not room even for the forged letters of Shelley, to which
Mr. Browning, being taken in thereby, wrote a preface, nor for
the forged letters of Mr. Ruskin, which occasionally hoax all the
newspapers.</p>

90</span><i>BIBLIOMANIA IN FRANCE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love of books for their own
sake, for their paper, print, binding, and for their
associations, as distinct from the love of literature, is a
stronger and more universal passion in France than elsewhere in
Europe.&nbsp; In England publishers are men of business; in
France they aspire to be artists.&nbsp; In England people borrow
what they read from the libraries, and take what gaudy
cloth-binding chance chooses to send them.&nbsp; In France people
buy books, and bind them to their heart&rsquo;s desire with
quaint and dainty devices on the morocco covers.&nbsp; Books are
lifelong friends in that country; in England they are the guests
of a week or of a fortnight.&nbsp; The greatest French writers
have been collectors of curious editions; they have devoted whole
treatises to the love of books.&nbsp; The literature and history
of France are full of anecdotes of the good and bad fortunes of
bibliophiles, of their bargains, discoveries,
disappointments.&nbsp; There lies before us at this moment a
small library of books about books,&mdash;the &lsquo;Bibliophile
Fran&ccedil;ais,&rsquo; in seven large volumes, &lsquo;Les
Sonnets d&rsquo;un Bibliophile,&rsquo; &lsquo;La Bibliomanie en
1878,&rsquo; &lsquo;La Biblioth&egrave;que d&rsquo;un
Bibliophile&rsquo; (1885) and a dozen other works of Janin,
Nodier, Beraldi, Pieters, Didot, great collectors who have
written for the instruction of beginners and the pleasure of
every one who takes delight in printed paper.</p>
<p>The passion for books, like other forms of desire, has its
changes of fashion.&nbsp; It is not always easy to justify the
caprices of taste.&nbsp; The presence or absence of half an inch
of paper in the &ldquo;uncut&rdquo; margin of a book makes a
difference of value that ranges from five shillings to a hundred
pounds.&nbsp; Some books are run after because they are
beautifully bound; some are competed for with equal eagerness
because they never have been bound at all.&nbsp; The uninitiated
often make absurd mistakes about these distinctions.&nbsp; Some
time ago the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reproached a collector
because his books were &ldquo;uncut,&rdquo; whence, argued the
journalist, it was clear that he had never read them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Uncut,&rdquo; of course, only means that the margins have
not been curtailed by the binders&rsquo; plough.&nbsp; It is a
point of sentiment to like books just as they left the hands of
the old printers,&mdash;of Estienne, Aldus, or Louis Elzevir.</p>
<p>It is because the passion for books is a sentimental passion
that people who have not felt it always fail to understand
it.&nbsp; Sentiment is not an easy thing to explain.&nbsp;
Englishmen especially find it impossible to understand tastes and
emotions that are not their own,&mdash;the wrongs of Ireland,
(till quite recently) the aspirations of Eastern Roumelia, the
demands of Greece.&nbsp; If we are to understand the book-hunter,
we must never forget that to him books are, in the first place,
<i>relics</i>.&nbsp; He likes to think that the great writers
whom he admires handled just such pages and saw such an
arrangement of type as he now beholds.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re, for
example, corrected the proofs for this edition of the
&lsquo;Pr&eacute;cieuses Ridicules,&rsquo; when he first
discovered &ldquo;what a labour it is to publish a book, and how
<i>green</i> (<i>neuf</i>) an author is the first time they print
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or it may be that Campanella turned over, with
hands unstrung, and still broken by the torture, these leaves
that contain his passionate sonnets.&nbsp; Here again is the copy
of Theocritus from which some pretty page may have read aloud to
charm the pagan and pontifical leisure of Leo X.&nbsp; This
Gargantua is the counterpart of that which the martyred Dolet
printed for (or pirated from, alas!) Ma&icirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ois
Rabelais.&nbsp; This woeful <i>ballade</i>, with the woodcut of
three thieves hanging from one gallows, came near being the
&ldquo;Last Dying Speech and Confession of Fran&ccedil;ois
Villon.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shabby copy of &lsquo;The Eve of St.
Agnes&rsquo; is precisely like that which Shelley doubled up and
thrust into his pocket when the prow of the piratical felucca
crashed into the timbers of the <i>Don Juan</i>.&nbsp; Some rare
books have these associations, and they bring you nearer to the
authors than do the modern reprints.&nbsp; Bibliophiles will tell
you that it is the early <i>readings</i> they care for,&mdash;the
author&rsquo;s first fancies, and those more hurried expressions
which he afterwards corrected.&nbsp; These <i>readings</i> have
their literary value, especially in the masterpieces of the
great; but the sentiment after all is the main thing.</p>
<p>Other books come to be relics in another way.&nbsp; They are
the copies which belonged to illustrious people,&mdash;to the
famous collectors who make a kind of <i>catena</i> (a golden
chain of bibliophiles) through the centuries since printing was
invented.&nbsp; There are Grolier (1479&ndash;1565),&mdash;not a
bookbinder, as an English newspaper supposed (probably when Mr.
Sala was on his travels),&mdash;De Thou (1553&ndash;1617), the
great Colbert, the Duc de la Valli&egrave;re (1708&ndash;1780),
Charles Nodier, a man of yesterday, M. Didot, and the rest, too
numerous to name.&nbsp; Again, there are the books of kings, like
Francis I., Henri III., and Louis XIV.&nbsp; These princes had
their favourite devices.&nbsp; Nicolas Eve, Padeloup, Derome, and
other artists arrayed their books in morocco,&mdash;tooled with
skulls, cross-bones, and crucifixions for the voluptuous pietist
Henri III., with the salamander for Francis I., and powdered with
<i>fleurs de lys</i> for the monarch who &ldquo;was the
State.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are relics also of noble
beauties.&nbsp; The volumes of Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me
are covered with golden daisies.&nbsp; The cipher of Marie
Antoinette adorns too many books that Madame du Barry might have
welcomed to her hastily improvised library.&nbsp; The three
daughters of Louis XV. had their favourite colours of morocco,
citron, red, and olive, and their books are valued as much as if
they bore the bees of De Thou, or the intertwined C&rsquo;s of
the illustrious and ridiculous Abb&eacute; Cotin, the
<i>Trissotin</i> of the comedy.&nbsp; Surely in all these things
there is a human interest, and our fingers are faintly thrilled,
as we touch these books, with the far-off contact of the hands of
kings and cardinals, scholars and <i>coquettes</i>, pedants,
poets, and <i>pr&eacute;cieuses</i>, the people who are
unforgotten in the mob that inhabited dead centuries.</p>
<p>So universal and ardent has the love of magnificent books been
in France, that it would be possible to write a kind of
bibliomaniac history of that country.&nbsp; All her rulers,
kings, cardinals, and ladies have had time to spare for
collecting.&nbsp; Without going too far back, to the time when
Bertha span and Charlemagne was an amateur, we may give a few
specimens of an anecdotical history of French bibliolatry,
beginning, as is courteous, with a lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can a woman
be a bibliophile?&rdquo; is a question which was once discussed
at the weekly breakfast party of Guilbert de
Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court, the famous book-lover and playwright,
the &ldquo;Corneille of the Boulevards.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
controversy glided into a discussion as to &ldquo;how many books
a man can love at a time;&rdquo; but historical examples prove
that French women (and Italian, witness the Princess
d&rsquo;Este) may be bibliophiles of the true strain.&nbsp; Diane
de Poictiers was their illustrious patroness.&nbsp; The mistress
of Henri II. possessed, in the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Anet, a
library of the first triumphs of typography.&nbsp; Her taste was
wide in range, including songs, plays, romances, divinity; her
copies of the Fathers were bound in citron morocco, stamped with
her arms and devices, and closed with clasps of silver.&nbsp; In
the love of books, as in everything else, Diane and Henri II.
were inseparable.&nbsp; The interlaced H and D are scattered over
the covers of their volumes; the lily of France is twined round
the crescents of Diane, or round the quiver, the arrows, and the
bow which she adopted as her cognisance, in honour of the maiden
goddess.&nbsp; The books of Henri and of Diane remained in the
Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Anet till the death of the Princesse de
Cond&eacute; in 1723, when they were dispersed.&nbsp; The son of
the famous Madame de Guyon bought the greater part of the
library, which has since been scattered again and again.&nbsp; M.
L&eacute;opold Double, a well-known bibliophile, possessed
several examples. <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a></p>
<p>Henry III. scarcely deserves, perhaps, the name of a
book-lover, for he probably never read the works which were bound
for him in the most elaborate way.&nbsp; But that great
historian, Alexandre Dumas, takes a far more friendly view of the
king&rsquo;s studies, and, in &lsquo;La Dame de Monsoreau,&rsquo;
introduces us to a learned monarch.&nbsp; Whether he cared for
the contents of his books or not, his books are among the most
singular relics of a character which excites even morbid
curiosity.&nbsp; No more debauched and worthless wretch ever
filled a throne; but, like the bad man in Aristotle, Henri III.
was &ldquo;full of repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he was not
dancing in an unseemly revel, he was on his knees in his
chapel.&nbsp; The board of one of his books, of which an
engraving lies before me, bears his cipher and crown in the
corners; but the centre is occupied in front with a picture of
the Annunciation, while on the back is the crucifixion and the
breeding heart through which the swords have pierced.&nbsp; His
favourite device was the death&rsquo;s-head, with the motto
<i>Memento Mori</i>, or <i>Spes mea Deus</i>.&nbsp; While he was
still only Duc d&rsquo;Anjou, Henri loved Marie de Cl&egrave;ves,
Princesse de Cond&eacute;.&nbsp; On her sudden death he expressed
his grief, as he had done his piety, by aid of the <i>petits
fers</i> of the bookbinder.&nbsp; Marie&rsquo;s initials were
stamped on his book-covers in a chaplet of laurels.&nbsp; In one
corner a skull and cross-bones were figured; in the other the
motto <i>Mort m&rsquo;est vie</i>; while two curly objects, which
did duty for tears, filled up the lower corners.&nbsp; The books
of Henri III., even when they are absolutely worthless as
literature, sell for high prices; and an inane treatise on
theology, decorated with his sacred emblems, lately brought about
&pound;120 in a London sale.</p>
<p>Francis I., as a patron of all the arts, was naturally an
amateur of bindings.&nbsp; The fates of books were curiously
illustrated by the story of the copy of Homer, on large paper,
which Aldus, the great Venetian printer, presented to Francis
I.&nbsp; After the death of the late Marquis of Hastings, better
known as an owner of horses than of books, his possessions were
brought to the hammer.&nbsp; With the instinct, the <i>flair</i>,
as the French say, of the bibliophile, M. Ambroise Firmin Didot,
the biographer of Aldus, guessed that the marquis might have
owned something in his line.&nbsp; He sent his agent over to
England, to the country town where the sale was to be held.&nbsp;
M. Didot had his reward.&nbsp; Among the books which were dragged
out of some mouldy store-room was the very Aldine Homer of
Francis I., with part of the original binding still clinging to
the leaves.&nbsp; M. Didot purchased the precious relic, and sent
it to what M. Fertiault (who has written a century of sonnets on
bibliomania) calls the hospital for books.</p>
<blockquote><p>Le dos humide, je l&rsquo;&eacute;ponge;<br />
O&ugrave; manque un coin, vite une allonge,<br />
Pour tous j&rsquo;ai maison de sant&eacute;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>M. Didot, of course, did not practise this amateur surgery
himself, but had the arms and devices of Francis I. restored by
one of those famous binders who only work for dukes,
millionnaires, and Rothschilds.</p>
<p>During the religious wars and the troubles of the Fronde, it
is probable that few people gave much time to the collection of
books.&nbsp; The illustrious exceptions are Richelieu and
Cardinal Mazarin, who possessed a &ldquo;snuffy Davy&rdquo; of
his own, an indefatigable prowler among book-stalls and dingy
purlieus, in Gabriel Naud&eacute;.&nbsp; In 1664, Naud&eacute;,
who was a learned and ingenious writer, the apologist for
&ldquo;great men suspected of magic,&rdquo; published the second
edition of his &lsquo;Avis pour dresser une
Biblioth&egrave;que,&rsquo; and proved himself to be a true lover
of the chase, a mighty hunter (of books) before the Lord.&nbsp;
Naud&eacute;&rsquo;s advice to the collector is rather
amusing.&nbsp; He pretends not to care much for bindings, and
quotes Seneca&rsquo;s rebuke of the Roman bibliomaniacs, <i>Quos
voluminum suorum frontes maxime placent titulique</i>,&mdash;who
chiefly care for the backs and lettering of their volumes.&nbsp;
The fact is that Naud&eacute; had the wealth of Mazarin at his
back, and we know very well, from the remains of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s library which exist, that he liked as well as
any man to see his cardinal&rsquo;s hat glittering on red or
olive morocco in the midst of the beautiful tooling of the early
seventeenth century.&nbsp; When once he got a book, he would not
spare to give it a worthy jacket.&nbsp; Naud&eacute;&rsquo;s
ideas about buying were peculiar.&nbsp; Perhaps he sailed rather
nearer the wind than even Monkbarns would have cared to do.&nbsp;
His favourite plan was to buy up whole libraries in the gross,
&ldquo;speculative lots&rdquo; as the dealers call them.&nbsp; In
the second place, he advised the book-lover to haunt the retreats
of <i>Libraires fripiers</i>, <i>et les vieux fonds et
magasins</i>.&nbsp; Here he truly observes that you may find rare
books, <i>broch&eacute;s</i>,&mdash;that is, unbound and
uncut,&mdash;just as Mr. Symonds bought two uncut copies of
&lsquo;Laon and Cythna&rsquo; in a Bristol stall for a
crown.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may get things for four or five crowns
that would cost you forty or fifty elsewhere,&rdquo; says
Naud&eacute;.&nbsp; Thus a few years ago M. Paul Lacroix bought
for two francs, in a Paris shop, the very copy of
&lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; which had belonged to Louis XIV.&nbsp; The
example may now be worth perhaps &pound;200.&nbsp; But we are
digressing into the pleasures of the modern sportsman.</p>
<p>It was not only in second-hand bookshops that Naud&eacute;
hunted, but among the dealers in waste paper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus
did Poggio find Quintilian on the counter of a wood-merchant, and
Masson picked up &lsquo;Agobardus&rsquo; at the shop of a binder,
who was going to use the MS. to patch his books
withal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rossi, who may have seen Naud&eacute; at
work, tells us how he would enter a shop with a yard-measure in
his hand, buying books, we are sorry to say, by the ell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The stalls where he had passed were like the towns through
which Attila or the Tartars had swept, with ruin in their
train,&mdash;<i>ut non hominis unius sedulitas</i>, <i>sed
calamitas quaedam per omnes bibliopolarum tabernas pervasisse
videatur</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Naud&eacute; had sorrows of his
own.&nbsp; In 1652 the Parliament decreed the confiscation of the
splendid library of Mazarin, which was perhaps the first free
library in Europe,&mdash;the first that was open to all who were
worthy of right of entrance.&nbsp; There is a painful description
of the sale, from which the book-lover will avert his eyes.&nbsp;
On Mazarin&rsquo;s return to power he managed to collect again
and enrich his stores, which form the germ of the existing
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine</i>.</p>
<p>Among princes and popes it is pleasant to meet one man of
letters, and he the greatest of the great age, who was a
bibliophile.&nbsp; The enemies and rivals of
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;De Vis&eacute;, De Villiers, and the
rest&mdash;are always reproaching him&mdash;with his love of
<i>bouquins</i>.&nbsp; There is some difference of opinion among
philologists about the derivation of <i>bouquin</i>, but all
book-hunters know the meaning of the word.&nbsp; The
<i>bouquin</i> is the &ldquo;small, rare volume, black with
tarnished gold,&rdquo; which lies among the wares of the
stall-keeper, patient in rain and dust, till the hunter comes who
can appreciate the quarry.&nbsp; We like to think of
Moli&egrave;re lounging through the narrow streets in the
evening, returning, perhaps, from some noble house where he has
been reading the proscribed &lsquo;Tartuffe,&rsquo; or giving an
imitation of the rival actors at the H&ocirc;tel Bourgogne.&nbsp;
Absent as the <i>contemplateur</i> is, a dingy book-stall wakens
him from his reverie.&nbsp; His lace ruffles are soiled in a
moment with the learned dust of ancient volumes.&nbsp; Perhaps he
picks up the only work out of all his library that is known to
exist,&mdash;<i>un ravissant petit Elzevir</i>, &lsquo;De Imperio
Magni Mogolis&rsquo; (Lugd.&nbsp; Bat. 1651).&nbsp; On the
title-page of this tiny volume, one of the minute series of
&lsquo;Republics&rsquo; which the Elzevirs published, the poet
has written his rare signature, &ldquo;J. B. P.
Moli&egrave;re,&rdquo; with the price the book cost him, &ldquo;1
livre, 10 sols.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;est pas de bouquin
qui s&rsquo;&eacute;chappe de ses mains,&rdquo; says the author
of &lsquo;La Guerre Comique,&rsquo; the last of the pamphlets
which flew about during the great literary quarrel about
&ldquo;L&rsquo;&Eacute;cole des Femmes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thanks to M.
Souli&eacute; the catalogue of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s library has
been found, though the books themselves have passed out of
view.&nbsp; There are about three hundred and fifty volumes in
the inventory, but Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s widow may have omitted
as valueless (it is the foible of her sex) many rusty
<i>bouquins</i>, now worth far more than their weight in
gold.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re owned no fewer than two hundred and
forty volumes of French and Italian comedies.&nbsp; From these he
took what suited him wherever he found it.&nbsp; He had plenty of
classics, histories, philosophic treatises, the essays of
Montaigne, a Plutarch, and a Bible.</p>
<p>We know nothing, to the regret of bibliophiles, of
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s taste in bindings.&nbsp; Did he have a
comic mask stamped on the leather (that device was chased on his
plate), or did he display his cognizance and arms, the two apes
that support a shield charged with three mirrors of Truth?&nbsp;
It is certain&mdash;La Bruy&egrave;re tells us as much&mdash;that
the sillier sort of book-lover in the seventeenth century was
much the same sort of person as his successor in our own
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man tells me he has a library,&rdquo; says
La Bruy&egrave;re (De la Mode); &ldquo;I ask permission to see
it.&nbsp; I go to visit my friend, and he receives me in a house
where, even on the stairs, the smell of the black morocco with
which his books are covered is so strong that I nearly
faint.&nbsp; He does his best to revive me; shouts in my ear that
the volumes &lsquo;have gilt edges,&rsquo; that they are
&lsquo;elegantly tooled,&rsquo; that they are &lsquo;of the good
edition,&rsquo; . . . and informs me that &lsquo;he never
reads,&rsquo; that &lsquo;he never sets foot in this part of his
house,&rsquo; that he &lsquo;will come to oblige me!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I thank him for all his kindness, and have no more desire than
himself to see the tanner&rsquo;s shop that he calls his
library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colbert, the great minister of Louis XIV., was a bibliophile
at whom perhaps La Bruy&egrave;re would have sneered.&nbsp; He
was a collector who did not read, but who amassed beautiful
books, and looked forward, as business men do, to the day when he
would have time to study them.&nbsp; After Grolier, De Thou, and
Mazarin, Colbert possessed probably the richest private library
in Europe.&nbsp; The ambassadors of France were charged to
procure him rare books and manuscripts, and it is said that in a
commercial treaty with the Porte he inserted a clause demanding a
certain quantity of Levant morocco for the use of the royal
bookbinders.&nbsp; England, in those days, had no literature with
which France deigned to be acquainted.&nbsp; Even into England,
however, valuable books had been imported; and we find Colbert
pressing the French ambassador at St. James&rsquo;s to bid for
him at a certain sale of rare heretical writings.&nbsp; People
who wanted to gain his favour approached him with presents of
books, and the city of Metz gave him two real
curiosities&mdash;the famous &ldquo;Metz Bible&rdquo; and the
Missal of Charles the Bald.&nbsp; The Elzevirs sent him their
best examples, and though Colbert probably saw more of the gilt
covers of his books than of their contents, at least he preserved
and handed down many valuable works.&nbsp; As much may be said
for the reprobate Cardinal Dubois, who, with all his faults, was
a collector.&nbsp; Bossuet, on the other hand, left little or
nothing of interest except a copy of the 1682 edition of
Moli&egrave;re, whom he detested and condemned to &ldquo;the
punishment of those who laugh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even this book, which
has a curious interest, has slipped out of sight, and may have
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>If Colbert and Dubois preserved books from destruction, there
are collectors enough who have been rescued from oblivion by
books.&nbsp; The diplomacy of D&rsquo;Hoym is forgotten; the
plays of Longepierre, and his quarrels with J. B. Rousseau, are
known only to the literary historian.&nbsp; These great amateurs
have secured an eternity of gilt edges, an immortality of
morocco.&nbsp; Absurd prices are given for any trash that
belonged to them, and the writer of this notice has bought for
four shillings an Elzevir classic, which when it bears the golden
fleece of Longepierre is worth about &pound;100.&nbsp;
Longepierre, D&rsquo;Hoym, McCarthy, and the Duc de la
Valli&egrave;re, with all their treasures, are less interesting
to us than Graille, Coche and Loque, the neglected daughters of
Louis XV.&nbsp; They found some pale consolation in their little
cabinets of books, in their various liveries of olive, citron,
and red morocco.</p>
<p>A lady amateur of high (book-collecting) reputation, the
Comtesse de Verrue, was represented in the Beckford sale by one
of three copies of &lsquo;L&rsquo;Histoire de
M&eacute;lusine,&rsquo; of Melusine, the twy-formed fairy, and
ancestress of the house of Lusignan.&nbsp; The Comtesse de
Verrue, one of the few women who have really understood
book-collecting, <a name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a> was born January 18, 1670, and died
November 18, 1736.&nbsp; She was the daughter of Charles de
Luynes and of his second wife, Anne de Rohan.&nbsp; When only
thirteen she married the Comte de Verrue, who somewhat
injudiciously presented her, a <i>fleur de quinze ans</i>, as
Ronsard says, at the court of Victor Amadeus of Savoy.&nbsp; It
is thought that the countess was less cruel than the <i>fleur
Angevine</i> of Ronsard.&nbsp; For some reason the young matron
fled from the court of Turin and returned to Paris, where she
built a magnificent hotel, and received the most distinguished
company.&nbsp; According to her biographer, the countess loved
science and art <i>jusqu&rsquo;au d&eacute;lire</i>, and she
collected the furniture of the period, without neglecting the
blue china of the glowing Orient.&nbsp; In ebony bookcases she
possessed about eighteen thousand volumes, bound by the greatest
artists of the day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without care for the present,
without fear of the future, doing good, pursuing the beautiful,
protecting the arts, with a tender heart and open hand, the
countess passed through life, calm, happy, beloved, and
admired.&rdquo;&nbsp; She left an epitaph on herself, thus rudely
translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lies, in sleep secure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dame inclined to mirth,<br />
Who, by way of making sure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Chose her Paradise on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the Revolution, to like well-bound books was as much as
to proclaim one an aristocrat.&nbsp; Condorcet might have escaped
the scaffold if he had only thrown away the neat little Horace
from the royal press, which betrayed him for no true Republican,
but an educated man.&nbsp; The great libraries from the
ch&acirc;teaux of the nobles were scattered among all the
book-stalls.&nbsp; True sons of freedom tore off the bindings,
with their gilded crests and scutcheons.&nbsp; One revolutionary
writer declared, and perhaps he was not far wrong, that the art
of binding was the worst enemy of reading.&nbsp; He always began
his studies by breaking the backs of the volumes he was about to
attack.&nbsp; The art of bookbinding in these sad years took
flight to England, and was kept alive by artists robust rather
than refined, like Thompson and Roger Payne.&nbsp; These were
evil days, when the binder had to cut the aristocratic coat of
arms out of a book cover, and glue in a gilt cap of liberty, as
in a volume in an Oxford amateur&rsquo;s collection.</p>
<p>When Napoleon became Emperor, he strove in vain to make the
troubled and feverish years of his power produce a
literature.&nbsp; He himself was one of the most voracious
readers of novels that ever lived.&nbsp; He was always asking for
the newest of the new, and unfortunately even the new romances of
his period were hopelessly bad.&nbsp; Barbier, his librarian, had
orders to send parcels of fresh fiction to his majesty wherever
he might happen to be, and great loads of novels followed
Napoleon to Germany, Spain, Italy, Russia.&nbsp; The conqueror
was very hard to please.&nbsp; He read in his travelling
carriage, and after skimming a few pages would throw a volume
that bored him out of the window into the highway.&nbsp; He might
have been tracked by his trail of romances, as was
Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb, in the fairy tale, by the white stones he
dropped behind him.&nbsp; Poor Barbier, who ministered to a
passion for novels that demanded twenty volumes a day, was at his
wit&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; He tried to foist on the Emperor the
romances of the year before last; but these Napoleon had
generally read, and he refused, with imperial scorn, to look at
them again.&nbsp; He ordered a travelling library of three
thousand volumes to be made for him, but it was proved that the
task could not be accomplished in less than six years.&nbsp; The
expense, if only fifty copies of each example had been printed,
would have amounted to more than six million francs.&nbsp; A
Roman emperor would not have allowed these considerations to
stand in his way; but Napoleon, after all, was a modern.&nbsp; He
contented himself with a selection of books conveniently small in
shape, and packed in sumptuous cases.&nbsp; The classical writers
of France could never content Napoleon, and even from Moscow in
1812, he wrote to Barbier clamorous for new books, and good
ones.&nbsp; Long before they could have reached Moscow, Napoleon
was flying homeward before Kotousoff and Benningsen.</p>
<p>Napoleon was the last of the book-lovers who governed
France.&nbsp; The Duc d&rsquo;Aumale, a famous bibliophile, has
never &ldquo;come to his own,&rdquo; and of M. Gambetta it is
only known that his devotional library, at least, has found its
way into the market.&nbsp; We have reached the era of private
book-fanciers: of Nodier, who had three libraries in his time,
but never a Virgil; and of Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court, the
dramatist, who founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bibliophiles
Fran&ccedil;ais.&nbsp; The Romantic movement in French literature
brought in some new fashions in book-hunting.&nbsp; The original
editions of Ronsard, Des Portes, Belleau, and Du Bellay became
invaluable; while the writings of Gautier, Petrus Borel, and
others excited the passion of collectors.&nbsp;
Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court was a believer in the works of the
Elzevirs.&nbsp; On one occasion, when he was outbid by a friend
at an auction, he cried passionately, &ldquo;I shall have that
book at your sale!&rdquo; and, the other poor bibliophile soon
falling into a decline and dying, Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court got
the volume which he so much desired.&nbsp; The superstitious
might have been excused for crediting him with the gift of
<i>jettatura</i>,&mdash;of the evil eye.&nbsp; On
Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court himself the evil eye fell at last; his
theatre, the Gaiet&eacute;, was burned down in 1835, and his
creditors intended to impound his beloved books.&nbsp; The
bibliophile hastily packed them in boxes, and conveyed them in
two cabs and under cover of night to the house of M. Paul
Lacroix.&nbsp; There they languished in exile till the affairs of
the manager were settled.</p>
<p>Pix&eacute;r&eacute;court and Nodier, the most reckless of
men, were the leaders of the older school of bibliomaniacs.&nbsp;
The former was not a rich man; the second was poor, but he never
hesitated in face of a price that he could not afford.&nbsp; He
would literally ruin himself in the accumulation of a library,
and then would recover his fortunes by selling his books.&nbsp;
Nodier passed through life without a Virgil, because he never
succeeded in finding the ideal Virgil of his dreams,&mdash;a
clean, uncut copy of the right Elzevir edition, with the
misprint, and the two passages in red letters.&nbsp; Perhaps this
failure was a judgment on him for the trick by which he beguiled
a certain collector of Bibles.&nbsp; He <i>invented</i> an
edition, and put the collector on the scent, which he followed
vainly, till he died of the sickness of hope deferred.</p>
<p>One has more sympathy with the eccentricities of Nodier than
with the mere extravagance of the new <i>haute &eacute;cole</i>
of bibliomaniacs, the school of millionnaires, royal dukes, and
Rothschilds.&nbsp; These amateurs are reckless of prices, and by
their competition have made it almost impossible for a poor man
to buy a precious book.&nbsp; The dukes, the Americans, the
public libraries, snap them all up in the auctions.&nbsp; A
glance at M. Gustave Brunet&rsquo;s little volume, &lsquo;La
Bibliomanie en 1878,&rsquo; will prove the excesses which these
people commit.&nbsp; The funeral oration of Bossuet over
Henriette Marie of France (1669), and Henriette Anne of England
(1670), quarto, in the original binding, are sold for
&pound;200.&nbsp; It is true that this copy had possibly belonged
to Bossuet himself, and certainly to his nephew.&nbsp; There is
an example, as we have seen, of the 1682 edition of
Moli&egrave;re,&mdash;of Moli&egrave;re whom Bossuet
detested,&mdash;which also belonged to the eagle of Meaux.&nbsp;
The manuscript notes of the divine on the work of the poor player
must be edifying, and in the interests of science it is to be
hoped that this book may soon come into the market.&nbsp; While
pamphlets of Bossuet are sold so dear, the first edition of
Homer&mdash;the beautiful edition of 1488, which the three young
Florentine gentlemen published&mdash;may be had for
&pound;100.&nbsp; Yet even that seems expensive, when we remember
that the copy in the library of George III. cost only seven
shillings.&nbsp; This exquisite Homer, sacred to the memory of
learned friendships, the chief offering of early printing at the
altar of ancient poetry, is really one of the most interesting
books in the world.&nbsp; Yet this Homer is less valued than the
tiny octavo which contains the <i>ballades and huitains</i> of
the scamp Fran&ccedil;ois Villon (1533).&nbsp; &lsquo;The History
of the Holy Grail&rsquo; (<i>L&rsquo;Hystoire du Sainct
Gr&eacute;aal</i>: Paris, 1523), in a binding stamped with the
four crowns of Louis XIV., is valued at about &pound;500.&nbsp; A
chivalric romance of the old days, which was treasured even in
the time of the <i>grand monarque</i>, when old French literature
was so much despised, is certainly a curiosity.&nbsp; The
Rabelais of Madame de Pompadour (in morocco) seems comparatively
cheap at &pound;60.&nbsp; There is something piquant in the idea
of inheriting from that famous beauty the work of the colossal
genius of Rabelais. <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a></p>
<p>The natural sympathy of collectors &ldquo;to middle fortune
born&rdquo; is not with the rich men whose sport in book-hunting
resembles the <i>battue</i>.&nbsp; We side with the poor hunters
of the wild game, who hang over the fourpenny stalls on the
<i>quais</i>, and dive into the dusty boxes after literary
pearls.&nbsp; These devoted men rise betimes, and hurry to the
stalls before the common tide of passengers goes by.&nbsp; Early
morning is the best moment in this, as in other sports.&nbsp; At
half past seven, in summer, the <i>bouquiniste</i>, the dealer in
cheap volumes at second-hand, arrays the books which he purchased
over night, the stray possessions of ruined families, the
outcasts of libraries.&nbsp; The old-fashioned bookseller knew
little of the value of his wares; it was his object to turn a
small certain profit on his expenditure.&nbsp; It is reckoned
that an energetic, business-like old bookseller will turn over
150,000 volumes in a year.&nbsp; In this vast number there must
be pickings for the humble collector who cannot afford to
encounter the children of Israel at Sotheby&rsquo;s or at the
H&ocirc;tel Drouot.</p>
<p>Let the enthusiast, in conclusion, throw a handful of lilies
on the grave of the martyr of the love of books,&mdash;the poet
Albert Glatigny.&nbsp; Poor Glatigny was the son of a <i>garde
champ&ecirc;tre</i>; his education was accidental, and his poetic
taste and skill extraordinarily fine and delicate.&nbsp; In his
life of starvation (he had often to sleep in omnibuses and
railway stations), he frequently spent the price of a dinner on a
new book.&nbsp; He lived to read and to dream, and if he bought
books he had not the wherewithal to live.&nbsp; Still, he bought
them,&mdash;and he died!&nbsp; His own poems were beautifully
printed by Lemerre, and it may be a joy to him (<i>si mentem
mortalia tangunt</i>) that they are now so highly valued that the
price of a copy would have kept the author alive and happy for a
month.</p>

109</span><i>OLD FRENCH TITLE-PAGES</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> can be plainer, as a rule,
than a modern English title-page.&nbsp; Its only beauty (if
beauty it possesses) consists in the arrangement and
&lsquo;massing&rsquo; of lines of type in various sizes.&nbsp; We
have returned almost to the primitive simplicity of the oldest
printed books, which had no title-pages, properly speaking, at
all, or merely gave, with extreme brevity, the name of the work,
without printer&rsquo;s mark, or date, or place.&nbsp; These were
reserved for the colophon, if it was thought desirable to mention
them at all.&nbsp; Thus, in the black-letter example of Guido de
Columna&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Troy,&rsquo; written about
1283, and printed at Strasburg in 1489, the title-page is blank,
except for the words,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><b>Hystoria Troiana
Guidonis</b>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>standing alone at the top of the leaf.&nbsp; The colophon
contains all the rest of the information, &lsquo;happily
completed in the City of Strasburg, in the year of Grace
Mcccclxxxix, about the Feast of St. Urban.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
printer and publisher give no name at all.</p>
<p>This early simplicity is succeeded, in French books, from,
say, 1510, and afterwards, by the insertion either of the
printer&rsquo;s trademark, or, in black-letter books, of a rough
woodcut, illustrative of the nature of the volume.&nbsp; The
woodcuts have occasionally a rude kind of grace, with a touch of
the classical taste of the early Renaissance surviving in extreme
decay.</p>
<p>An excellent example is the title-page of &lsquo;Les Demandes
d&rsquo;amours, avec les responses joyeuses,&rsquo; published by
Jacques Moderne, at Lyon, 1540.&nbsp; There is a certain Pagan
breadth and joyousness in the figure of Amor, and the man in the
hood resembles traditional portraits of Dante.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There is more humour, and a good deal of skill, in the
title-page of a book on late marriages and their discomforts,
&lsquo;Les dictz et complainctes de trop Tard mari&eacute;&rsquo;
(Jacques Moderne, Lyon, 1540), where we see the elderly and
comfortable couple sitting gravely under their own fig-tree.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Jacques Moderne was a printer curious in these quaint devices,
and used them in most of his books: for example, in &lsquo;How
Satan and the God Bacchus accuse the Publicans that spoil the
wine,&rsquo; Bacchus and Satan (exactly like each other, as Sir
Wilfrid Lawson will not be surprised to hear) are encouraging
dishonest tavern-keepers to stew in their own juice in a caldron
over a huge fire.&nbsp; From the same popular publisher came a
little tract on various modes of sport, if the name of sport can
be applied to the netting of fish and birds.&nbsp; The work is
styled &lsquo;Livret nouveau auquel sont contenuz xxv receptes de
prendre poissons et oiseaulx avec les mains.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
countryman clad in a goat&rsquo;s skin with the head and horns
drawn over his head as a hood, is dragging ashore a net full of
fishes.&nbsp; There is no more characteristic frontispiece of
this black-letter sort than the woodcut representing a gallows
with three men hanging on it, which illustrates Villon&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Ballade des Pendus,&rsquo; and is reproduced in Mr. John
Payne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Poems of Master Francis Villon of
Paris&rsquo; (London, 1878). <a name="citation119a"></a><a
href="#footnote119a" class="citation">[119a]</a></p>
<p>Earlier in date than these vignettes of Jacques Moderne, but
much more artistic and refined in design, are some frontispieces
of small octavos printed <i>en lettres rondes</i>, about
1530.&nbsp; In these rubricated letters are used with brilliant
effect.&nbsp; One of the best is the title-page of Galliot du
Pr&eacute;&rsquo;s edition of &lsquo;Le Rommant de la Rose&rsquo;
(Paris, 1529). <a name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b"
class="citation">[119b]</a>&nbsp; Galliot du Pr&eacute;&rsquo;s
artist, however, surpassed even the charming device of the Lover
plucking the Rose, in his title-page, of the same date, for the
small octavo edition of Alain Chartier&rsquo;s poems, which we
reproduce here.</p>

<p>The arrangement of letters, and the use of red, make a
charming frame, as it were, to the drawing of the medi&aelig;val
ship, with the Motto VOGUE LA GALEE.</p>
<p>Title-pages like these, with designs appropriate to the
character of the text, were superseded presently by the fashion
of badges, devices, and mottoes.&nbsp; As courtiers and ladies
had their private badges, not hereditary, like crests, but
personal&mdash;the crescent of Diane, the salamander of Francis
I., the skulls and cross-bones of Henri III., the
<i>marguerites</i> of Marguerite, with mottoes like the <i>Le
Banny de liesse</i>, <i>Le traverseur des voies
p&eacute;rilleuses</i>, <i>Tout par Soulas</i>, and the like, so
printers and authors had their emblems, and their private
literary slogans.&nbsp; These they changed, accordinging to
fancy, or the vicissitudes of their lives.&nbsp; Cl&eacute;ment
Marot&rsquo;s motto was <i>La Mort n&rsquo;y Mord</i>.&nbsp; It
is indicated by the letters L. M. N. M. in the curious title of
an edition of Marot&rsquo;s works published at Lyons by Jean de
Tournes in 1579.&nbsp; The portrait represents the poet when the
tide of years had borne him far from his youth, far from
<i>L&rsquo;Adolescence Cl&eacute;mentine</i>.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Etienne Dolet, perhaps the only publisher who
was ever burned, used an ominous device, a trunk of a tree, with
the axe struck into it.&nbsp; In publishing &lsquo;Les
Marguerites de la Marguerite des Princesses, tr&egrave;s illustre
Royne de Navarre,&rsquo; Jean de Tournes employed a pretty
allegorical device.&nbsp; Love, with the bandage thrust back from
his eyes, and with the bow and arrows in his hand, has flown up
to the sun, which he seems to touch; like Prometheus in the myth
when he stole the fire, a shower of flowers and flames falls
around him.&nbsp; Groueleau, of Paris, had for motto <i>Nul ne
s&rsquo;y frotte</i>, with the thistle for badge.&nbsp; These are
beautifully combined in the title-page of his version of
Apuleius, &lsquo;L&rsquo;Amour de Cupido et de Psyche&rsquo;
(Paris, 1557).&nbsp; There is probably no better date for
frontispieces, both for ingenuity of device and for elegance of
arrangement of title, than the years between 1530 and 1560.&nbsp;
By 1562, when the first edition of the famous Fifth Book of
Rabelais was published, the printers appear to have thought
devices wasted on popular books, and the title of the
Master&rsquo;s posthumous chapters is printed quite simply.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p116b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Gargantva"
title=
"Gargantva"
 src="images/p116s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In 1532&ndash;35 there was a more adventurous
taste&mdash;witness the title of &lsquo;Gargantua.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This beautiful title decorates the first known edition, with a
date of the First Book of Rabelais.&nbsp; It was sold, most
appropriately, <i>devant nostre Dame de Confort</i>.&nbsp; Why
should so glorious a relic of the Master have been carried out of
England, at the Sunderland sale?&nbsp; All the early titles of
Fran&ccedil;ois Juste&rsquo;s Lyons editions of Rabelais are on
this model.&nbsp; By 1542 he dropped the framework of
architectural design.&nbsp; By 1565 Richard Breton, in Paris, was
printing Rabelais with a frontispiece of a classical dame holding
a heart to the sun, a figure which is almost in the taste of
Stothard, or Flaxman.</p>
<p>The taste for vignettes, engraved on copper, not on wood, was
revived under the Elzevirs.&nbsp; Their pretty little title-pages
are not so well known but that we offer examples.&nbsp; In the
essay on the Elzevirs in this volume will be found a copy of the
vignette of the &lsquo;Imitatio Christi,&rsquo; and of &lsquo;Le
Pastissier Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo; a reproduction is given here
(pp. 114, 115).&nbsp; The artists they employed had plenty of
fancy, not backed by very profound skill in design.</p>
<p>In the same <i>genre</i> as the big-wigged classicism of the
Elzevir vignettes, in an age when Louis XIV. and Moli&egrave;re
(in tragedy) wore laurel wreaths over vast perruques, are the
early frontispieces of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s own collected
works.&nbsp; Probably the most interesting of all French
title-pages are those drawn by Chauveau for the two volumes
&lsquo;Les Oeuvres de M. de Moli&egrave;re,&rsquo; published in
1666 by Guillaume de Luynes.&nbsp; The first shows Moli&egrave;re
in two characters, as Mascarille, and as Sganarelle, in &lsquo;Le
Cocu Imaginaire.&rsquo;&nbsp; Contrast the full-blown jollity of
the <i>fourbum imperator</i>, in his hat, and feather, and wig,
and vast <i>canons</i>, and tremendous shoe-tie, with the lean
melancholy of jealous Sganarelle.&nbsp; These are two notable
aspects of the genius of the great comedian.&nbsp; The apes below
are the supporters of his scutcheon.</p>
<p>The second volume shows the Muse of Comedy crowning Mlle. de
Moli&egrave;re (Armande B&eacute;jart) in the dress of
Agn&egrave;s, while her husband is in the costume, apparently, of
Tartuffe, or of Sganarelle in &lsquo;L&rsquo;Ecole des
Femmes.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Tartuffe&rsquo; had not yet been
licensed for a public stage.&nbsp; The interest of the portraits
and costumes makes these title-pages precious, they are
historical documents rather than mere curiosities.</p>
<p>These title-pages of Moli&egrave;re are the highwater mark of
French taste in this branch of decoration.&nbsp; In the old
quarto first editions of Corneille&rsquo;s early plays, such as
&lsquo;Le Cid&rsquo; (Paris 1637), the printers used lax and
sprawling combinations of flowers and fruit.&nbsp; These, a
little better executed, were the staple of Ribou, de Luynes,
Quinet, and the other Parisian booksellers who, one after
another, failed to satisfy Moli&egrave;re as publishers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The basket of fruits on the title-page of
&lsquo;Iphig&eacute;nie,&rsquo; par M. Racine (Barbin, Paris,
1675), is almost, but not quite, identical with the similar
ornament of De Vis&eacute;&rsquo;s &lsquo;La Cocue
Imaginaire&rsquo; (Ribou, Paris 1662).&nbsp; Many of
Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s plays appearing first, separately, in
small octavo, were adorned with frontispieces, illustrative of
some scene in the comedy.&nbsp; Thus, in the
&lsquo;Misanthrope&rsquo; (Rihou 1667) we see Alceste, green
ribbons and all, discoursing with Philinte, or perhaps listening
to the famous sonnet of Oronte; it is not easy to be quite
certain, but the expression of Alceste&rsquo;s face looks rather
as if he were being baited with a sonnet.&nbsp; From the close of
the seventeenth century onwards, the taste for title-pages
declined, except when Moreau or Gravelot drew vignettes on
copper, with abundance of cupids and nymphs.&nbsp; These were
designed for very luxurious and expensive books; for others, men
contented themselves with a bald simplicity, which has prevailed
till our own time.&nbsp; In recent years the employment of
publishers&rsquo; devices has been less unusual and more
agreeable.&nbsp; Thus Poulet Malassis had his <i>armes
parlantes</i>, a chicken very uncomfortably perched on a
rail.&nbsp; In England we have the cipher and bees of Messrs.
Macmillan, the Trees of Life and Knowledge of Messrs. Kegan Paul
and Trench, the Ship, which was the sign of Messrs.
Longman&rsquo;s early place of business, and doubtless other
symbols, all capable of being quaintly treated in a
title-page.</p>
<h2><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span><i>A
BOOKMAN&rsquo;S PURGATORY</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Blinton</span> was a
book-hunter.&nbsp; He had always been a book-hunter, ever since,
at an extremely early age, he had awakened to the errors of his
ways as a collector of stamps and monograms.&nbsp; In
book-hunting he saw no harm; nay, he would contrast its joys, in
a rather pharisaical style, with the pleasures of shooting and
fishing.&nbsp; He constantly declined to believe that the devil
came for that renowned amateur of black letter, G.
Steevens.&nbsp; Dibdin himself, who tells the story (with obvious
anxiety and alarm), pretends to refuse credit to the ghastly
narrative.&nbsp; &ldquo;His language,&rdquo; says Dibdin, in his
account of the book-hunter&rsquo;s end, &ldquo;was, too
frequently, the language of imprecation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
rather good, as if Dibdin thought a gentleman might swear pretty
often, but not &ldquo;<i>too</i> frequently.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Although I am not disposed to admit,&rdquo; Dibdin goes
on, &ldquo;the <i>whole</i> of the testimony of the good woman
who watched by Steevens&rsquo;s bedside, although my prejudices
(as they may be called) will not allow me to believe that the
windows shook, and that strange noises and deep groans were heard
at midnight in his room, yet no creature of common sense (and
this woman possessed the quality in an eminent degree) could
mistake oaths for prayers;&rdquo; and so forth.&nbsp; In short,
Dibdin clearly holds that the windows did shake &ldquo;without a
blast,&rdquo; like the banners in Branxholme Hall when somebody
came for the Goblin Page.</p>
<p>But Thomas Blinton would hear of none of these things.&nbsp;
He said that his taste made him take exercise; that he walked
from the City to West Kensington every day, to beat the covers of
the book-stalls, while other men travelled in the expensive cab
or the unwholesome Metropolitan Railway.&nbsp; We are all apt to
hold favourable views of our own amusements, and, for my own
part, I believe that trout and salmon are incapable of feeling
pain.&nbsp; But the flimsiness of Blinton&rsquo;s theories must
be apparent to every unbiassed moralist.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;harmless taste&rdquo; really involved most of the deadly
sins, or at all events a fair working majority of them.&nbsp; He
coveted his neighbours&rsquo; books.&nbsp; When he got the chance
he bought books in a cheap market and sold them in a dear market,
thereby degrading literature to the level of trade.&nbsp; He took
advantage of the ignorance of uneducated persons who kept
book-stalls.&nbsp; He was envious, and grudged the good fortune
of others, while he rejoiced in their failures.&nbsp; He turned a
deaf ear to the appeals of poverty.&nbsp; He was luxurious, and
laid out more money than he should have done on his selfish
pleasures, often adorning a volume with a morocco binding when
Mrs. Blinton sighed in vain for some old <i>point
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on</i> lace.&nbsp; Greedy, proud, envious,
stingy, extravagant, and sharp in his dealings, Blinton was
guilty of most of the sins which the Church recognises as
&ldquo;deadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the very day before that of which the affecting history is
now to be told, Blinton had been running the usual round of
crime.&nbsp; He had (as far as intentions went) defrauded a
bookseller in Holywell Street by purchasing from him, for the sum
of two shillings, what he took to be a very rare Elzevir.&nbsp;
It is true that when he got home and consulted
&lsquo;Willems,&rsquo; he found that he had got hold of the wrong
copy, in which the figures denoting the numbers of pages are
printed right, and which is therefore worth exactly
&ldquo;nuppence&rdquo; to the collector.&nbsp; But the intention
is the thing, and Blinton&rsquo;s intention was distinctly
fraudulent.&nbsp; When he discovered his error, then &ldquo;his
language,&rdquo; as Dibdin says, &ldquo;was that of
imprecation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Worse (if possible) than this, Blinton
had gone to a sale, begun to bid for &lsquo;Les Essais de Michel,
Seigneur de Montaigne&rsquo; (Foppens, MDCLIX.), and, carried
away by excitement, had &ldquo;plunged&rdquo; to the extent of
&pound;15, which was precisely the amount of money he owed his
plumber and gasfitter, a worthy man with a large family.&nbsp;
Then, meeting a friend (if the book-hunter has friends), or
rather an accomplice in lawless enterprise, Blinton had remarked
the glee on the other&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The poor man had
purchased a little old Olaus Magnus, with woodcuts, representing
were-wolves, fire-drakes, and other fearful wild-fowl, and was
happy in his bargain.&nbsp; But Blinton, with fiendish joy,
pointed out to him that the index was imperfect, and left him
sorrowing.</p>
<p>Deeds more foul have yet to be told.&nbsp; Thomas Blinton had
discovered a new sin, so to speak, in the collecting way.&nbsp;
Aristophanes says of one of his favourite blackguards, &ldquo;Not
only is he a villain, but he has invented an original
villainy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blinton was like this.&nbsp; He maintained
that every man who came to notoriety had, at some period,
published a volume of poems which he had afterwards repented of
and withdrawn.&nbsp; It was Blinton&rsquo;s hideous pleasure to
collect stray copies of these unhappy volumes, these
&lsquo;P&eacute;ch&eacute;s de Jeunesse,&rsquo; which, always and
invariably, bear a gushing inscription from the author to a
friend.&nbsp; He had all Lord John Manners&rsquo;s poems, and
even Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He had the &lsquo;Ode to
Despair&rsquo; of Smith (now a comic writer), and the &lsquo;Love
Lyrics&rsquo; of Brown, who is now a permanent under-secretary,
than which nothing can be less gay nor more permanent.&nbsp; He
had the amatory songs which a dignitary of the Church published
and withdrew from circulation.&nbsp; Blinton was wont to say he
expected to come across &lsquo;Triolets of a Tribune,&rsquo; by
Mr. John Bright, and &lsquo;Original Hymns for Infant
Minds,&rsquo; by Mr. Henry Labouchere, if he only hunted long
enough.</p>
<p>On the day of which I speak he had secured a volume of
love-poems which the author had done his best to destroy, and he
had gone to his club and read all the funniest passages aloud to
friends of the author, who was on the club committee.&nbsp; Ah,
was this a kind action?&nbsp; In short, Blinton had filled up the
cup of his iniquities, and nobody will be surprised to hear that
he met the appropriate punishment of his offence.&nbsp; Blinton
had passed, on the whole, a happy day, notwithstanding the error
about the Elzevir.&nbsp; He dined well at his club, went home,
slept well, and started next morning for his office in the City,
walking, as usual, and intending to pursue the pleasures of the
chase at all the book-stalls.&nbsp; At the very first, in the
Brompton Road, he saw a man turning over the rubbish in the cheap
box.&nbsp; Blinton stared at him, fancied he knew him, thought he
didn&rsquo;t, and then became a prey to the glittering eye of the
other.&nbsp; The Stranger, who wore the conventional cloak and
slouched soft hat of Strangers, was apparently an accomplished
mesmerist, or thought-reader, or adept, or esoteric
Buddhist.&nbsp; He resembled Mr. Isaacs, Zanoni (in the novel of
that name), Mendoza (in &lsquo;Codlingsby&rsquo;), the soul-less
man in &lsquo;A Strange Story,&rsquo; Mr. Home, Mr. Irving
Bishop, a Buddhist adept in the astral body, and most other
mysterious characters of history and fiction.&nbsp; Before his
Awful Will, Blinton&rsquo;s mere modern obstinacy shrank back
like a child abashed.&nbsp; The Stranger glided to him and
whispered, &ldquo;Buy these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These&rdquo; were a complete set of Auerbach&rsquo;s
novels, in English, which, I need not say, Blinton would never
have dreamt of purchasing had he been left to his own
devices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy these!&rdquo; repeated the Adept, or whatever he
was, in a cruel whisper.&nbsp; Paying the sum demanded, and
trailing his vast load of German romance, poor Blinton followed
the fiend.</p>
<p>They reached a stall where, amongst much trash,
Glatigny&rsquo;s &lsquo;Jour de l&rsquo;An d&rsquo;un
Vagabond&rsquo; was exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Blinton, &ldquo;there is a book I
have wanted some time.&nbsp; Glatignys are getting rather scarce,
and it is an amusing trifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, buy <i>that</i>,&rdquo; said the implacable
Stranger, pointing with a hooked forefinger at Alison&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of Europe&rsquo; in an indefinite number of
volumes.&nbsp; Blinton shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, buy <i>that</i>, and why?&nbsp; In heaven&rsquo;s
name, what could I do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy it,&rdquo; repeated the persecutor, &ldquo;and
<i>that</i>&rdquo; (indicating the &lsquo;Ilios&rsquo; of Dr.
Schliemann, a bulky work), &ldquo;and <i>these</i>&rdquo;
(pointing to all Mr. Theodore Alois Buckley&rsquo;s translations
of the Classics), &ldquo;and <i>these</i>&rdquo; (glancing at the
collected writings of the late Mr. Hain Friswell, and at a
&lsquo;Life,&rsquo; in more than one volume, of Mr.
Gladstone).</p>
<p>The miserable Blinton paid, and trudged along carrying the
bargains under his arm.&nbsp; Now one book fell out, now another
dropped by the way.&nbsp; Sometimes a portion of Alison came
ponderously to earth; sometimes the &lsquo;Gentle Life&rsquo;
sunk resignedly to the ground.&nbsp; The Adept kept picking them
up again, and packing them under the arms of the weary
Blinton.</p>
<p>The victim now attempted to put on an air of geniality, and
tried to enter into conversation with his tormentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>does</i> know about books,&rdquo; thought
Blinton, &ldquo;and he must have a weak spot
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the wretched amateur made play in his best conversational
style.&nbsp; He talked of bindings, of Maioli, of Grolier, of De
Thou, of Derome, of Clovis Eve, of Roger Payne, of Trautz, and
eke of Bauzonnet.&nbsp; He discoursed of first editions, of black
letter, and even of illustrations and vignettes.&nbsp; He
approached the topic of Bibles, but here his tyrant, with a
fierce yet timid glance, interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy those!&rdquo; he hissed through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those&rdquo; were the complete publications of the Folk
Lore Society.</p>
<p>Blinton did not care for folk lore (very bad men never do),
but he had to act as he was told.</p>
<p>Then, without pause or remorse, he was charged to acquire the
&lsquo;Ethics&rsquo; of Aristotle, in the agreeable versions of
Williams and Chase.&nbsp; Next he secured
&lsquo;Strathmore,&rsquo; &lsquo;Chandos,&rsquo; &lsquo;Under Two
Flags,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Two Little Wooden Shoes,&rsquo; and
several dozens more of Ouida&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; The next stall
was entirely filled with school-books, old geographies, Livys,
Delectuses, Arnold&rsquo;s &lsquo;Greek Exercises,&rsquo;
Ollendorffs, and what not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy them all,&rdquo; hissed the fiend.&nbsp; He seized
whole boxes and piled them on Blinton&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>He tied up Ouida&rsquo;s novels, in two parcels, with string,
and fastened each to one of the buttons above the tails of
Blinton&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired?&rdquo; asked the tormentor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never mind, these books will soon be off your
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking, the Stranger, with amazing speed, hurried Blinton
back through Holywell Street, along the Strand, and up to
Piccadilly, stopping at last at the door of Blinton&rsquo;s
famous and very expensive binder.</p>
<p>The binder opened his eyes, as well he might, at the vision of
Blinton&rsquo;s treasures.&nbsp; Then the miserable Blinton found
himself, as it were automatically and without any exercise of his
will, speaking thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are some things I have picked up,&mdash;extremely
rare,&mdash;and you will oblige me by binding them in your best
manner, regardless of expense.&nbsp; Morocco, of course; crushed
levant morocco, <i>doubl&eacute;</i>, every book of them,
<i>petits fers</i>, my crest and coat of arms, plenty of
gilding.&nbsp; Spare no cost.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t keep me waiting,
as you generally do;&rdquo; for indeed book-binders are the most
dilatory of the human species.</p>
<p>Before the astonished binder could ask the most necessary
questions, Blinton&rsquo;s tormentor had hurried that amateur out
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on to the sale,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sale?&rdquo; said Blinton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Beckford sale; it is the thirteenth day, a
lucky day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have forgotten my catalogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the third shelf from the top, on the right-hand side
of the ebony book-case at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger stretched out his arm, which swiftly elongated
itself till the hand disappeared from view round the
corner.&nbsp; In a moment the hand returned with the
catalogue.&nbsp; The pair sped on to Messrs. Sotheby&rsquo;s
auction-rooms in Wellington Street.&nbsp; Every one knows the
appearance of a great book-sale.&nbsp; The long table, surrounded
by eager bidders, resembles from a little distance a roulette
table, and communicates the same sort of excitement.&nbsp; The
amateur is at a loss to know how to conduct himself.&nbsp; If he
bids in his own person some bookseller will outbid him, partly
because the bookseller knows, after all, he knows little about
books, and suspects that the amateur may, in this case, know
more.&nbsp; Besides, professionals always dislike amateurs, and,
in this game, they have a very great advantage.&nbsp; Blinton
knew all this, and was in the habit of giving his commissions to
a broker.&nbsp; But now he felt (and very naturally) as if a
demon had entered into him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tirante il Bianco
Valorosissimo Cavaliere&rsquo; was being competed for, an
excessively rare romance of chivalry, in magnificent red Venetian
morocco, from Canevari&rsquo;s library.&nbsp; The book is one of
the rarest of the Venetian Press, and beautifully adorned with
Canevari&rsquo;s device,&mdash;a simple and elegant affair in
gold and colours.&nbsp; &ldquo;Apollo is driving his chariot
across the green waves towards the rock, on which winged Pegasus
is pawing the ground,&rdquo; though why this action of a horse
should be called &ldquo;pawing&rdquo; (the animal notoriously not
possessing paws) it is hard to say.&nbsp; Round this graceful
design is the inscription &Omicron;&Rho;&Theta;&Omega;&Sigma;
&Kappa;&Alpha;&Iota; &Mu;&Eta;
&Alpha;&Omicron;&Xi;&Iota;&Omega;&Sigma; (straight not
crooked).&nbsp; In his ordinary mood Blinton could only have
admired &lsquo;Tirante il Bianco&rsquo; from a distance.&nbsp;
But now, the demon inspiring him, he rushed into the lists, and
challenged the great Mr. &mdash;, the Napoleon of
bookselling.&nbsp; The price had already reached five hundred
pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hundred,&rdquo; cried Blinton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guineas,&rdquo; said the great Mr. &mdash;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven hundred,&rdquo; screamed Blinton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guineas,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>This arithmetical dialogue went on till even Mr. &mdash;
struck his flag, with a sigh, when the maddened Blinton had said
&ldquo;Six thousand.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cheers of the audience
rewarded the largest bid ever made for any book.&nbsp; As if he
had not done enough, the Stranger now impelled Blinton to contend
with Mr. &mdash; for every expensive work that appeared.&nbsp;
The audience naturally fancied that Blinton was in the earlier
stage of softening of the brain, when a man conceives himself to
have inherited boundless wealth, and is determined to live up to
it.&nbsp; The hammer fell for the last time.&nbsp; Blinton owed
some fifty thousand pounds, and exclaimed audibly, as the
influence of the fiend died out, &ldquo;I am a ruined
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your books must be sold,&rdquo; cried the
Stranger, and, leaping on a chair, he addressed the
audience:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I invite you to Mr. Blinton&rsquo;s sale,
which will immediately take place.&nbsp; The collection contains
some very remarkable early English poets, many first editions of
the French classics, most of the rarer Aldines, and a singular
assortment of Americana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment, as if by magic, the shelves round the room were
filled with Blinton&rsquo;s books, all tied up in big lots of
some thirty volumes each.&nbsp; His early Moli&egrave;res were
fastened to old French dictionaries and school-books.&nbsp; His
Shakespeare quartos were in the same lot with tattered railway
novels.&nbsp; His copy (almost unique) of Richard
Barnfield&rsquo;s much too &lsquo;Affectionate Shepheard&rsquo;
was coupled with odd volumes of &lsquo;Chips from a German
Workshop&rsquo; and a cheap, imperfect example of &lsquo;Tom
Brown&rsquo;s School-Days.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hookes&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Amanda&rsquo; was at the bottom of a lot of American
devotional works, where it kept company with an Elzevir Tacitus
and the Aldine &lsquo;Hypnerotomachia.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
auctioneer put up lot after lot, and Blinton plainly saw that the
whole affair was a &ldquo;knock-out.&rdquo;&nbsp; His most
treasured spoils were parted with at the price of waste
paper.&nbsp; It is an awful thing to be present at one&rsquo;s
own sale.&nbsp; No man would bid above a few shillings.&nbsp;
Well did Blinton know that after the knock-out the plunder would
be shared among the grinning bidders.&nbsp; At last his
&lsquo;Adonais,&rsquo; uncut, bound by Lortic, went, in company
with some old &lsquo;Bradshaws,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Court
Guide&rsquo; of 1881, and an odd volume of the &lsquo;Sunday at
Home,&rsquo; for sixpence.&nbsp; The Stranger smiled a smile of
peculiar malignity.&nbsp; Blinton leaped up to protest; the room
seemed to shake around him, but words would not come to his
lips.</p>
<p>Then he heard a familiar voice observe, as a familiar grasp
shook his shoulder,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, Tom, what a nightmare you are enjoying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in his own arm-chair, where he had fallen asleep after
dinner, and Mrs. Blinton was doing her best to arouse him from
his awful vision.&nbsp; Beside him lay &lsquo;L&rsquo;Enfer du
Bibliophile, vu et d&eacute;crit par Charles
Asselineau.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Paris: Tardieu, MDCCCLX.)</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If this were an ordinary tract, I should have to tell how
Blinton&rsquo;s eyes were opened, how he gave up book-collecting,
and took to gardening, or politics, or something of that
sort.&nbsp; But truth compels me to admit that Blinton&rsquo;s
repentance had vanished by the end of the week, when he was
discovered marking M. Claudin&rsquo;s catalogue, surreptitiously,
before breakfast.&nbsp; Thus, indeed, end all our remorses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lancelot falls to his own love again,&rdquo; as in the
romance.&nbsp; Much, and justly, as theologians decry a death-bed
repentance, it is, perhaps, the only repentance that we do not
repent of.&nbsp; All others leave us ready, when occasion comes,
to fall to our old love again; and may that love never be worse
than the taste for old books!&nbsp; Once a collector, always a
collector.&nbsp; <i>Moi qui parle</i>, I have sinned, and
struggled, and fallen.&nbsp; I have thrown catalogues, unopened,
into the waste-paper basket.&nbsp; I have withheld my feet from
the paths that lead to Sotheby&rsquo;s and to
Puttick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have crossed the street to avoid a
book-stall.&nbsp; In fact, like the prophet Nicholas, &ldquo;I
have been known to be steady for weeks at a time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then the fatal moment of temptation has arrived, and I have
succumbed to the soft seductions of Eisen, or Cochin, or an old
book on Angling.&nbsp; Probably Grolier was thinking of such
weaknesses when he chose his devices <i>Tanquam Ventus</i>, and
<i>quisque suos patimur Manes</i>.&nbsp; Like the wind we are
blown about, and, like the people in the &AElig;neid, we are
obliged to suffer the consequences of our own extravagance.</p>

135</span><i>LADY BOOK-LOVERS</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> biographer of Mrs. Aphra Behn
refutes the vulgar error that &ldquo;a Dutchman cannot
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether or not a lady can love books is a
question that may not be so readily settled.&nbsp; Mr. Ernest
Quentin Bauchart has contributed to the discussion of this
problem by publishing a bibliography, in two quarto volumes, of
books which have been in the libraries of famous beauties of old,
queens and princesses of France.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that
these ladies were possessors of exquisite printed books and
manuscripts wonderfully bound, but it remains uncertain whether
the owners, as a rule, were bibliophiles; whether their hearts
were with their treasures.&nbsp; Incredible as it may seem to us
now, literature was highly respected in the past, and was even
fashionable.&nbsp; Poets were in favour at court, and Fashion
decided that the great must possess books, and not only books,
but books produced in the utmost perfection of art, and bound
with all the skill at the disposal of Clovis Eve, and Padeloup,
and Duseuil.&nbsp; Therefore, as Fashion gave her commands, we
cannot hastily affirm that the ladies who obeyed were really
book-lovers.&nbsp; In our more polite age, Fashion has decreed
that ladies shall smoke, and bet, and romp, but it would be
premature to assert that all ladies who do their duty in these
matters are born romps, or have an unaffected liking for
cigarettes.&nbsp; History, however, maintains that many of the
renowned dames whose books are now the most treasured of literary
relics were actually inclined to study as well as to pleasure,
like Marguerite de Valois and the Comtesse de Verrue, and even
Madame de Pompadour.&nbsp; Probably books and arts were more to
this lady&rsquo;s liking than the diversions by which she
beguiled the tedium of Louis XV.; and many a time she would
rather have been quiet with her plays and novels than engaged in
conscientiously conducted but distasteful revels.</p>
<p>Like a true Frenchman, M. Bauchart has only written about
French lady book-lovers, or about women who, like Mary Stuart,
were more than half French.&nbsp; Nor would it be easy for an
English author to name, outside the ranks of crowned heads, like
Elizabeth, any Englishwomen of distinction who had a passion for
the material side of literature, for binding, and first editions,
and large paper, and engravings in early
&ldquo;states.&rdquo;&nbsp; The practical sex, when studious, is
like the same sex when fond of equestrian exercise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A lady says, &lsquo;My heyes, he&rsquo;s an &rsquo;orse,
and he must go,&rsquo;&rdquo; according to Leech&rsquo;s
groom.&nbsp; In the same way, a studious girl or matron says,
&ldquo;This is a book,&rdquo; and reads it, if read she does,
without caring about the date, or the state, or the
publisher&rsquo;s name, or even very often about the
author&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I remember, before the publication of a
novel now celebrated, seeing a privately printed vellum-bound
copy on large paper in the hands of a literary lady.&nbsp; She
was holding it over the fire, and had already made the vellum
covers curl wide open like the shells of an afflicted oyster.</p>
<p>When I asked what the volume was, she explained that &ldquo;It
is a book which a poor man has written, and he&rsquo;s had it
printed to see whether some one won&rsquo;t be kind enough to
publish it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ventured, perhaps pedantically, to
point out that the poor man could not be so very poor, or he
would not have made so costly an experiment on Dutch paper.&nbsp;
But the lady said she did not know how that might be, and she
went on toasting the experiment.&nbsp; In all this there is a
fine contempt for everything but the spiritual aspect of
literature; there is an aversion to the mere coquetry and display
of morocco and red letters, and the toys which amuse the minds of
men.&nbsp; Where ladies have caught &ldquo;the
Bibliomania,&rdquo; I fancy they have taken this pretty fever
from the other sex.&nbsp; But it must be owned that the books
they have possessed, being rarer and more romantic, are even more
highly prized by amateurs than examples from the libraries of
Grolier, and Longepierre, and D&rsquo;Hoym.&nbsp; M.
Bauchart&rsquo;s book is a complete guide to the collector of
these expensive relics.&nbsp; He begins his dream of fair women
who have owned books with the pearl of the Valois, Marguerite
d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, the sister of Francis I.&nbsp; The
remains of her library are chiefly devotional manuscripts.&nbsp;
Indeed, it is to be noted that all these ladies, however
frivolous, possessed the most devout and pious books, and whole
collections of prayers copied out by the pen, and decorated with
miniatures.&nbsp; Marguerite&rsquo;s library was bound in
morocco, stamped with a crowned M in <i>interlacs</i> sown with
daisies, or, at least, with conventional flowers which may have
been meant for daisies.&nbsp; If one could choose, perhaps the
most desirable of the specimens extant is &lsquo;Le Premier Livre
du Prince des Po&egrave;tes, Hom&egrave;re,&rsquo; in
Salel&rsquo;s translation.&nbsp; For this translation Ronsard
writes a prologue, addressed to the <i>manes</i> of Salel, in
which he complains that he is ridiculed for his poetry.&nbsp; He
draws a characteristic picture of Homer and Salel in Elysium,
among the learned lovers:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qui
parmi les fleurs devisent<br />
Au giron de leur dame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marguerite&rsquo;s manuscript copy of the First Book of the
Iliad is a small quarto, adorned with daisies, fleurs de-lis, and
the crowned M.&nbsp; It is in the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale&rsquo;s
collection at Chantilly.&nbsp; The books of Diane de Poitiers are
more numerous and more famous.&nbsp; When first a widow she
stamped her volumes with a laurel springing from a tomb, and the
motto, &ldquo;Sola vivit in illo.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when she
consoled herself with Henri II. she suppressed the tomb, and made
the motto meaningless.&nbsp; Her crescent shone not only on her
books, but on the palace walls of France, in the Louvre,
Fontainebleau, and Anet, and her initial D. is inextricably
interlaced with the H. of her royal lover.&nbsp; Indeed, Henri
added the D to his own cypher, and this must have been so
embarrassing for his wife Catherine, that people have
good-naturedly tried to read the curves of the D&rsquo;s as
C&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The D&rsquo;s, and the crescents, and the bows
of his Diana are impressed even on the covers of Henri&rsquo;s
Book of Hours.&nbsp; Catherine&rsquo;s own cypher is a double C
enlaced with an H, or double K&rsquo;s (Katherine) combined in
the same manner.&nbsp; These, unlike the D.H., are surmounted
with a crown&mdash;the one advantage which the wife possessed
over the favourite.&nbsp; Among Diane&rsquo;s books are various
treatises on medicines and on surgery, and plenty of poetry and
Italian novels.&nbsp; Among the books exhibited at the British
Museum in glass cases is Diane&rsquo;s copy of Bembo&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of Venice.&rsquo;&nbsp; An American collector, Mr.
Barlow, of New York, is happy enough to possess her
&lsquo;Singularitez de la France Antarctique&rsquo; (Antwerp,
1558).</p>
<p>Catherine de Medicis got splendid books on the same terms as
foreign pirates procure English novels&mdash;she stole
them.&nbsp; The Marshal Strozzi, dying in the French service,
left a noble collection, on which Catherine laid her hands.&nbsp;
Brant&ocirc;me says that Strozzi&rsquo;s son often expressed to
him a candid opinion about this transaction.&nbsp; What with her
own collection and what with the Marshal&rsquo;s, Catherine
possessed about four thousand volumes.&nbsp; On her death they
were in peril of being seized by her creditors, but her almoner
carried them to his own house, and De Thou had them placed in the
royal library.&nbsp; Unluckily it was thought wiser to strip the
books of the coats with Catherine&rsquo;s compromising device,
lest her creditors should single them out, and take them away in
their pockets.&nbsp; Hence, books with her arms and cypher are
exceedingly rare.&nbsp; At the sale of the collections of the
Duchesse de Berry, a Book of Hours of Catherine&rsquo;s was sold
for &pound;2,400.</p>
<p>Mary Stuart of Scotland was one of the lady book-lovers whose
taste was more than a mere following of the fashion.&nbsp; Some
of her books, like one of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s, were the
companions of her captivity, and still bear the sad complaints
which she entrusted to these last friends of fallen
royalty.&nbsp; Her note-book, in which she wrote her Latin prose
exercises when a girl, still survives, bound in red morocco, with
the arms of France.&nbsp; In a Book of Hours, now the property of
the Czar, may be partly deciphered the quatrains which she
composed in her sorrowful years, but many of them are mutilated
by the binder&rsquo;s shears.&nbsp; The Queen used the volume as
a kind of album: it contains the signatures of the
&ldquo;Countess of Schrewsbury&rdquo; (as M. Bauchart has it), of
Walsingham, of the Earl of Sussex, and of Charles Howard, Earl of
Nottingham.&nbsp; There is also the signature, &ldquo;Your most
infortunat, <span class="smcap">Arbella Seymour</span>;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Fr. Bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remarkable manuscript was purchased in Paris, during the
Revolution, by Peter Dubrowsky, who carried it to Russia.&nbsp;
Another Book of Hours of the Queen&rsquo;s bears this
inscription, in a sixteenth-century hand: &ldquo;Ce sont les
Heures de Marie Setuart Renne.&nbsp; Marguerite de Blacuod de
Rosay.&rdquo;&nbsp; In De Blacuod it is not very easy to
recognise &ldquo;Blackwood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marguerite was probably
the daughter of Adam Blackwood, who wrote a volume on Mary
Stuart&rsquo;s sufferings (Edinburgh, 1587).</p>
<p>The famous Marguerite de Valois, the wife of Henri IV., had
certainly a noble library, and many beautifully bound books
stamped with daisies are attributed to her collections.&nbsp;
They bear the motto, &ldquo;Expectata non eludet,&rdquo; which
appears to refer, first to the daisy (&ldquo;Margarita&rdquo;),
which is punctual in the spring, or rather is &ldquo;the
constellated flower that never sets,&rdquo; and next, to the
lady, who will &ldquo;keep tryst.&rdquo;&nbsp; But is the lady
Marguerite de Valois?&nbsp; Though the books have been sold at
very high prices as relics of the leman of La Mole, it seems
impossible to demonstrate that they were ever on her shelves,
that they were bound by Clovis Eve from her own design. &ldquo;No
mention is made of them in any contemporary document, and the
judicious are reduced to conjectures.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet they form
a most important collection, systematically bound, science and
philosophy in citron morocco, the poets in green, and history and
theology in red.&nbsp; In any case it is absurd to explain
&ldquo;Expectata non eludet&rdquo; as a reference to the lily of
the royal arms, which appears on the centre of the daisy-pied
volumes.&nbsp; The motto, in that case, would run,
&ldquo;Expectata (lilia) non eludent.&rdquo;&nbsp; As it stands,
the feminine adjective, &ldquo;expectata,&rdquo; in the singular,
must apply either to the lady who owned the volumes, or to the
&ldquo;Margarita,&rdquo; her emblem, or to both.&nbsp; Yet the
ungrammatical rendering is that which M. Bauchart suggests.&nbsp;
Many of the books, Marguerite&rsquo;s or not, were sold at prices
over &pound;100 in London, in 1884 and 1883.&nbsp; The Macrobius,
and Theocritus, and Homer are in the Cracherode collection at the
British Museum.&nbsp; The daisy crowned Ronsard went for
&pound;430 at the Beckford sale.&nbsp; These prices will probably
never be reached again.</p>
<p>If Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis XIV., was a
bibliophile, she may be suspected of acting on the motive,
&ldquo;Love me, love my books.&rdquo;&nbsp; About her affection
for Cardinal Mazarin there seems to be no doubt: the Cardinal had
a famous library, and his royal friend probably imitated his
tastes.&nbsp; In her time, and on her volumes, the originality
and taste of the skilled binder, Le Gascon, begin to declare
themselves.&nbsp; The fashionable passion for lace, to which La
Fontaine made such sacrifices, affected the art of book
decorations, and Le Gascon&rsquo;s beautiful patterns of gold
points and dots are copies of the productions of Venice.&nbsp;
The Queen-Mother&rsquo;s books include many devotional treatises,
for, whatever other fashions might come and go, piety was always
constant before the Revolution.&nbsp; Anne of Austria seems to
have been particularly fond of the lives and works of Saint
Theresa, and Saint Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales, and John of the
Cross.&nbsp; But she was not unread in the old French poets, such
as Coquillart; she condescended to Ariosto; she had that dubious
character, Th&eacute;ophile de Viaud, beautifully bound; she
owned the Rabelais of 1553; and, what is particularly
interesting, M. de Lignerolles possesses her copy of
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Eschole des Femmes, Com&eacute;die par J. B. P.
Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Paris: Guillaume de Luynes,
1663.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 12&deg;, red morocco, gilt edges, and the
Queen&rsquo;s arms on the covers.&nbsp; This relic is especially
valuable when we remember that &lsquo;L&rsquo;Ecole des
Femmes&rsquo; and Arnolphe&rsquo;s sermon to Agn&egrave;s, and
his comic threats of future punishment first made envy take the
form of religious persecution.&nbsp; The devout Queen-Mother was
often appealed to by the enemies of Moli&egrave;re, yet Anne of
Austria had not only seen his comedy, but possessed this
beautiful example of the first edition.&nbsp; M. Paul Lacroix
supposes that this copy was offered to the Queen-Mother by
Moli&egrave;re himself.&nbsp; The frontispiece (Arnolphe
preaching to Agn&egrave;s) is thought to be a portrait of
Moli&egrave;re, but in the reproduction in M. Louis
Lacour&rsquo;s edition it is not easy to see any
resemblance.&nbsp; Apparently Anne did not share the views, even
in her later years, of the converted Prince de Conty, for several
comedies and novels remain stamped with her arms and device.</p>
<p>The learned Marquise de Rambouillet, the parent of all the
&lsquo;Pr&eacute;cieuses,&rsquo; must have owned a good library,
but nothing is chronicled save her celebrated book of prayers and
meditations, written out and decorated by Jarry.&nbsp; It is
bound in red morocco, <i>doubl&eacute;</i> with green, and
covered with V&rsquo;s in gold.&nbsp; The Marquise composed the
prayers for her own use, and Jarry was so much struck with their
beauty that he asked leave to introduce them into the Book of
Hours which he had to copy, &ldquo;for the prayers are often so
silly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I am ashamed to write them
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is an example of the devotions which Jarry admired, a
prayer to Saint Louis.&nbsp; It was published in
&lsquo;Miscellanies Bibliographiques&rsquo; by M. Prosper
Blanchemain.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">PRI&Egrave;RE &Agrave;
SAINT-LOUIS,<br />
<span class="smcap">Roy de France</span>.</p>
<p>Grand Roy, bien que votre couronne ayt est&eacute; des plus
esclatantes de la Terre, celle que vous portez dans le ciel est
incomparablement plus pr&eacute;cieuse.&nbsp; L&rsquo;une estoit
perissable l&rsquo;autre est immortelle et ces lys dont la
blancheur se pouvoit ternir, sont maintenant
incorruptibles.&nbsp; Vostre obeissance envers vostre
m&egrave;re; vostre justice envers vos sujets; et vos guerres
contre les infideles, vous ont acquis la veneration de tous les
peuples; et la France doit &agrave; vos travaux et &agrave;
vostre pi&eacute;t&eacute; l&rsquo;inestimable tresor de la
sanglante et glorieuse couronne du Sauveur du monde.&nbsp;
Priez-le incomparable Saint qu&rsquo;il donne une paix
perpetu&euml;lle au Royaume dont vous avez port&eacute; le
sceptre; qu&rsquo;il le pr&eacute;serve
d&rsquo;h&eacute;r&eacute;sie; qu&rsquo;il y face to&ucirc;jours
regner saintement vostre illustre Sang; et que tous ceux qui ont
l&rsquo;honneur d&rsquo;en descendre soient pour jamais
fid&egrave;les &agrave; son Eglise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The daughter of the Marquise, the fair Julie, heroine of that
&ldquo;long courting&rdquo; by M. de Montausier, survives in
those records as the possessor of &lsquo;La Guirlande de
Julie,&rsquo; the manuscript book of poems by eminent
hands.&nbsp; But this manuscript seems to have been all the
library of Julie; therein she could constantly read of her own
perfections.&nbsp; To be sure she had also
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Histoire de Gustave Adolphe,&rsquo; a hero for
whom, like Major Dugald Dalgetty, she cherished a supreme
devotion.&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Guirlande&rsquo; Chapelain&rsquo;s
verses turn on the pleasing fancy that the Protestant Lion of the
North, changed into a flower (like Paul Limayrac in M.
Banville&rsquo;s ode), requests Julie to take pity on his altered
estate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sois pitoyable &agrave; ma langueur;<br />
Et si je n&rsquo;ay place en ton c&oelig;ur<br />
Que je l&rsquo;aye au moins sur ta teste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses were reckoned consummate.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Guirlande&rsquo; is still, with happier fate than
attends most books, in the hands of the successors of the Duc and
Duchesse de Montausier.</p>
<p>Like Julie, Madame de Maintenon was a <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>,
but she never had time to form a regular library.&nbsp; Her
books, however, were bound by Duseuil, a binder immortal in the
verse of Pope; or it might be more correct to say that Madame de
Maintenon&rsquo;s own books are seldom distinguishable from those
of her favourite foundation, St. Cyr.&nbsp; The most interesting
is a copy of the first edition of &lsquo;Esther,&rsquo; in quarto
(1689), bound in red morocco, and bearing, in Racine&rsquo;s
hand, &ldquo;<i>A Madame la Marquise de Maintenon</i>, <i>offert
avec respect</i>,&mdash;<span
class="smcap"><i>Racine</i></span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless Racine had the book bound before he presented
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;People are discontented,&rdquo; writes his son
Louis, &ldquo;if you offer them a book in a simple marbled paper
cover.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could wish that this worthy custom were
restored, for the sake of the art of binding, and also because
amateur poets would be more chary of their presentation
copies.&nbsp; It is, no doubt, wise to turn these gifts with
their sides against the inner walls of bookcases, to be bulwarks
against the damp, but the trouble of acknowledging worthless
presents from strangers is considerable. <a
name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a></p>
<p>Another interesting example of Madame de Maintenon&rsquo;s
collections is Dacier&rsquo;s &lsquo;Remarques Critiques sur les
&OElig;uvres d&rsquo;Horace,&rsquo; bearing the arms of Louis
XIV., but with his wife&rsquo;s signature on the fly-leaf
(1681).</p>
<p>Of Madame de Montespan, ousted from the royal favour by Madame
de Maintenon, who &ldquo;married into the family where she had
been governess,&rdquo; there survives one bookish relic of
interest.&nbsp; This is &lsquo;&OElig;uvres Diverses par un
auteur de sept ans,&rsquo; in quarto, red morocco, printed on
vellum, and with the arms of the mother of the little Duc du
Maine (1678).&nbsp; When Madame de Maintenon was still playing
mother to the children of the king and of Madame de Montespan,
she printed those &ldquo;works&rdquo; of her eldest pupil.</p>
<p>These ladies were only bibliophiles by accident, and were
devoted, in the first place, to pleasure, piety, or
ambition.&nbsp; With the Comtesse de Verrue, whose epitaph will
be found on an earlier page, we come to a genuine and even
fanatical collector.&nbsp; Madame de Verrue (1670&ndash;1736) got
every kind of diversion out of life, and when she ceased to be
young and fair, she turned to the joys of
&ldquo;shopping.&rdquo;&nbsp; In early years, &ldquo;pleine de
c&oelig;ur, elle le donna sans comptes.&rdquo;&nbsp; In later
life, she purchased, or obtained on credit, everything that
caught her fancy, also <i>sans comptes</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
aunt,&rdquo; says the Duc de Luynes, &ldquo;was always buying,
and never baulked her fancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pictures, books, coins,
jewels, engravings, gems (over 8,000), tapestries, and furniture
were all alike precious to Madame de Verrue.&nbsp; Her
snuff-boxes defied computation; she had them in gold, in
tortoise-shell, in porcelain, in lacquer, and in jasper, and she
enjoyed the delicate fragrance of sixty different sorts of
snuff.&nbsp; Without applauding the smoking of cigarettes in
drawing-rooms, we may admit that it is less repulsive than steady
applications to tobacco in Madame de Verrue&rsquo;s favourite
manner.</p>
<p>The Countess had a noble library, for old tastes survived in
her commodious heart, and new tastes she anticipated.&nbsp; She
possessed &lsquo;The Romance of the Rose,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Villon,&rsquo; in editions of Galliot du Pr&eacute;
(1529&ndash;1533) undeterred by the satire of Boileau.&nbsp; She
had examples of the &lsquo;Ple&iuml;ade,&rsquo; though they were
not again admired in France till 1830.&nbsp; She was also in the
most modern fashion of to-day, for she had the beautiful quarto
of La Fontaine&rsquo;s &lsquo;Contes,&rsquo; and Bouchier&rsquo;s
illustrated Moli&egrave;re (large paper).&nbsp; And, what I envy
her more, she had Perrault&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fairy Tales,&rsquo; in
blue morocco&mdash;the blue rose of the folklorist who is also a
book-hunter.&nbsp; It must also be confessed that Madame de
Verrue had a large number of books such as are usually kept under
lock and key, books which her heirs did not care to expose at the
sale of her library.&nbsp; Once I myself (<i>moi
ch&eacute;tif</i>) owned a novel in blue morocco, which had been
in the collection of Madame de Verrue.&nbsp; In her old age this
exemplary woman invented a peculiarly comfortable arm-chair,
which, like her novels, was covered with citron and violet
morocco; the nails were of silver.&nbsp; If Madame de Verrue has
met the Baroness Bernstein, their conversation in the Elysian
Fields must be of the most gallant and interesting
description.</p>
<p>Another literary lady of pleasure, Madame de Pompadour, can
only be spoken of with modified approval.&nbsp; Her great fault
was that she did not check the decadence of taste and sense in
the art of bookbinding.&nbsp; In her time came in the habit of
binding books (if binding it can be called) with flat backs,
without the nerves and sinews that are of the very essence of
book-covers.&nbsp; Without these no binding can be permanent,
none can secure the lasting existence of a volume.&nbsp; It is
very deeply to be deplored that by far the most accomplished
living English artist in bookbinding has reverted to this old and
most dangerous heresy.&nbsp; The most original and graceful
tooling is of much less real value than permanence, and a book
bound with a flat back, without <i>nerfs</i>, might practically
as well not be bound at all.&nbsp; The practice was the herald of
the French and may open the way for the English Revolution.&nbsp;
Of what avail were the ingenious mosaics of Derome to stem the
tide of change, when the books whose sides they adorned were not
really <i>bound</i> at all?&nbsp; Madame de Pompadour&rsquo;s
books were of all sorts, from the inevitable works of devotions
to devotions of another sort, and the &lsquo;Hours&rsquo; of
Erycina Ridens.&nbsp; One of her treasures had singular fortunes,
a copy of &lsquo;Daphnis and Chloe,&rsquo; with the
Regent&rsquo;s illustrations, and those of Cochin and Eisen
(Paris, quarto, 1757, red morocco).&nbsp; The covers are adorned
with billing and cooing doves, with the arrows of Eros, with
burning hearts, and sheep and shepherds.&nbsp; Eighteen years ago
this volume was bought for 10 francs in a village in
Hungary.&nbsp; A bookseller gave &pound;8 for it in Paris.&nbsp;
M. Bauchart paid for it &pound;150; and as it has left his
shelves, probably he too made no bad bargain.&nbsp; Madame de
Pompadour&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apology for Herodotus&rsquo; (La Haye,
1735) has also its legend.&nbsp; It belonged to M. Paillet, who
coveted a glorified copy of the &lsquo;Pastissier
Fran&ccedil;ois,&rsquo; in M. Bauchart&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp;
M Paillet swopped it, with a number of others, for the
&lsquo;Pastissier:&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J&rsquo;avais
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Apologie<br />
Pour H&eacute;rodote,&rsquo; en reli&ucirc;re ancienne, amour<br
/>
De livre provenant de chez la Pompadour<br />
Il me le soutira! <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Marie Antoinette, with whom our lady book-lovers of the old
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> must close, there survive many books.&nbsp;
She had a library in the Tuileries, as well as at le petit
Trianon.&nbsp; Of all her great and varied collections, none is
now so valued as her little book of prayers, which was her
consolation in the worst of all her evil days, in the Temple and
the Conciergerie.&nbsp; The book is &lsquo;Office de la Divine
Providence&rsquo; (Paris, 1757, green morocco).&nbsp; On the
fly-leaf the Queen wrote, some hours before her death, these
touching lines: &ldquo;Ce 16 Octobre, &agrave; 4 h. &frac12; du
matin.&nbsp; Mon Dieu! ayez piti&eacute; de moi!&nbsp; Mes yeux
n&rsquo;ont plus de larmes pour prier pour vous, mes pauvres
enfants.&nbsp; Adieu, adieu!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marie
Antoinette</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be no sadder relic of a greater sorrow, and the last
consolation of the Queen did not escape the French popular genius
for cruelty and insult.&nbsp; The arms on the covers of the
prayer-book have been cut out by some fanatic of Equality and
Fraternity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
